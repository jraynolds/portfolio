		"<em>What’s better than the American Old West? Well, the West when it was raw and untamed and full of things that you might call magic or you might call superstition or you might call a tall tale. But there’s something about those tall tales, haven’t you noticed? The more people tell them, the taller they get. The realer they get. The more they start to be able to reach their fingers through the veil between story and reality and grab hold.</em>",
    "<em>Some good friends of mine have done a Kickstarter campaign for an Old West RPG in this setting. It’s finished, but if you want to give it a look be my guest. The name is “American Sunset,” and they asked me to write a short piece on it.</em>",
    "<em>This is a story about a farm boy who thinks he knows a lot more than he really does, and how it ends up almost biting him in the end.</em>",
    "My name is Isaiah Colwell, and I submit that these stories you hear about religion, magic and any and all gods are worth just about as much as a bit of spare ear’s wax. Maybe less: at least the wax helps keep out all that horse puckey. Ma and Pa–if you are reading this it is meant for you; any other fellow can keep his grubby paws off these records unless you have my word in writing or I am dead and in the ground.",
    "Let me say first that if you hear the name “Carlisle Ward” I advise you to turn the other way and keep walking until the name is gone from your ears and maybe some more past that. He is a no-good crook and would be destined for the fires of Hell if they existed. He preyed upon the good people of my homestead and they, being good god-fearing people, lacked the training in rhetoric to weigh his words. He spoke of earthly fire and brimstone which shocked my Ma so much she developed the faints and they put a tremor in my Pa’s hands too. He swore that Judgment Day was here and had been ever since settlers reached the end of the West: elsewise (or so he said) why would such devils and supernatural occurrences plague us? Ma and Pa: he is the devil, if any exists, and I swear to you that when I return you will have a full accounting of the strangeness he spoke of. I will show to you each of his stories for a sham and I will see to it every queer happening he cites is exposed for its real self.<br>It is for this reason further schooling is not my path, Pa, at least not until I can send that odious man running with his tail between his legs. I lied to you when I said it was the school I gathered up my things and set off for: I will gladly accept a whipping when I return, but my path is righteous and you always said a man should pursue what he thinks is good. That is why I am bound for Silver Springs, Pa, and I will pass my own judgment on whether it is like Carlisle says.",
    "<h3>SILVER SPRINGS</h3>",
    "My arrival in the town itself was less auspicious than I might have expected. Entering our close-knit community would garner at most a welcome party and at least a few curious eyes, but it became immediately obvious to me that the big city is a very different kind of place. Rather than greetings what I did receive was almost complete disinterest. Not a soul spied me riding into town–covered in dust from head to foot–and gave me more than a passing glance. It seems likely to me that of all the lies Carlisle told, that Silver Springs is a melting pot in true American fashion is not one of them. In the short span it took me to enter the town proper I saw a group of Chinamen, a group of rowdy Irish drunkards and a fellow who must have been some sort of Injun. It has been a long time since our home was raided but I must confess a feeling of slight unease settled over me as I passed him. I considered slipping away your old revolver with me when I left, Pa, but you did not raise a thief. Besides, if I am right and Silver Springs is only one large mess of tall tales Carlisle told, as I expect, I will hardly need it. The Injun did not seem to mind me so I tried not to mind him too much. I left my good horse Daisy tied to a post and wandered into the town proper.",
    "The town of Silver Springs is solidly situated right between the best and the worst Carlisle has attributed to it. It is no swath of mansions but no ramshackle affair neither, although I did see parts of both. It seems just like any other frontier town, only a little larger than the nearby place you sent me to for Ma’s medicine several years back. The outskirts of the town are full of small dwellings inhabited by the worse sorts, but inside the town proper the buildings and the people became more uniform. Despite all the tales Carlisle told of silver rushes and constant discovery of any and all minerals, I was only able to pick out one or two miners out-of-doors. With no small amount of satisfaction, I put to rest the first of Carlisle’s lies.",
    "The streets were sparsely populated to the extent I wondered about if everyone was at church, but it was scarcely a minute before I came upon a street vendor addressing a small crowd. He was an oily looking man up on a soapbox, and in one hand he clutched a small vial. In a wheedling voice he touted the health improvements just a single drop could convey. In the space of a single minute he must have sworn it could do ten different things, and then he started in on the ingredients. He told them all but for a single, keystone part which he explained was part of his “secret formula.” Access to which, he promised, would be granted upon purchasing at least twenty of the small vials. I couldn’t believe my ears when he uttered the price: 5 dollars. A man could buy a horse with that much money, unless a dollar is lighter here in the city.",
    "The crowd was hardly sold, especially after being told the price, but before his listeners began to wane the salesman announced a demonstration would be held. He dabbed a few drops on his wrists, cracked his knuckles, and ran his eyes through the crowd. When he spied a particularly burly man he called him up in front of the crowd and rolled up his sleeves. The two of them began to arm wrestle and in front of all of us he beat the man handily. Before this display not a single individual looked likely to purchase a vial of his concoction, but now there were murmurs through the crowd. A woman in front of me was debating with her husband whether that tonic might help him repair a failing fence, and if perhaps the cost might be worth tightening their belts for a spell. About that time I spied a lawman of some sort leaning against a nearby building. I felt he would certainly intervene and keep these good people from losing hold of their senses, but although he met my eyes he did not move so much as a muscle.",
    "I confess, Pa, I saw an amount of Carlisle in that salesman. I stepped forward and called to the fraud (as I believed him to be) that for a good show he should wrestle two men, not one. He seemed to ponder this, and upon closely examining me agreed. We set up in front of the crowd and I rolled my sleeves up past the elbow. He placed a few more drops of the tonic on his palm, rubbed them in, and acted as if it had invigorated him. The man was oilier still from a closer vantage point, and looking at him seemed like to make me ill. I stared instead at his hand and noticed it seemed excessively slick. I recalled on the farm, Pa, when you taught me how to catch the hogs when they burst the pen, and I patted my right hand down on my dust-covered pants. I believe he intended me to slip when we clasped hands, and to undo me in that instant, but he found a tougher challenge than I expect he planned for. All the same he was a strong man, but despite my thinness I am after all a farmer’s son. I forced his hand down after a moment and the crowd began to murmur. He made a show of being duly impressed by my strength, but I do believe the damage had been done. Before long the crowd filtered away and I trust he received no more than two purchases.",
    "<h3>SHERIFF HAMMOND</h3>",
    "After the success I enjoyed making a spectacle of that fraud, I was in a fine huff. I found the nearby lawman I’d spied earlier and set my course straight for him. He had a silver star for a badge and a pair of six-shooters on his hips but I laid into him proper anyways, asking him what kind of sheriff let his people get fleeced by a man like that. I took him for older than you, Pa, on account of his grey hair and the deep-etched lines in his face. Up close I could see that weren’t the truth, and all things being equal… the look in his eyes brought me up short. You always did say I had a habit of going off half-cocked and I expect you are right. He didn’t seem a fist-fighting man, though, and instead he rebuffed me in a real East coast accent. He did his best to set me straight on a couple things, but I can be as stubborn as our old Ox. He could tell I was not taking to it and told me in no uncertain terms Silver Springs had enough troublemakers already. Imagine! Me, a troublemaker, when all I am attempting is to set things right where they lay crooked. He started to get a look in his eye I did not like the sight of, but backing down is as little in me as it is in you, Pa. I hope you appreciate that. Anyways before he had my bacon cooked, a group of rag-tags came milling by and took up the Sheriff’s attention. They were speaking about some sort of haunting but I had to take the opportunity when it came into view. I backed off and caught one last glare from the Sheriff. I decided he and I were on opposite sides of the playing field, so to speak, and to avoid him wherever possible.",
    "After my close brush with the law, I decided on some spirits to calm my nerves. As a matter of fact, locating a liquor establishment was less a task than choosing which to patronize. One, “The Silver Tap,” caught my eye and drew me in. Inside the place was not too rowdy, and I confess the wide row of bottles behind the bar left me a mite star-struck. I ordered myself a small scotch and nursed it for an hour or so, trying in my own fashion to discover the next step of my journey. In Silver Springs for half a day and being already on the Sheriff’s worse side, I was beginning to feel pretty low. I do admit thinking about quitting my search but returning after a day seemed worse than anything. As luck would have it (you might say it was divine intervention, Ma) just as I was thinking on leaving the establishment that same rag-tag bunch entered. I recognized them as the folks who had saved me from the Sheriff, but they did not seem to recognize me. I let them get a few drinks in, and then approached them. I am no actor like Carlisle, so I only told them the facts: I am a farm boy from over yonder, and I am here to put to rest a few myths on account of a conflict with another individual. At first I think they did not believe me, but a round of drinks set us up as good friends.",
    "I learned over the evening that man was named Sheriff Hammond, and these four were his new recruits. They seemed a trifle mixed on motivations but as far as I am a good judge of character they appeared decent folks. As they began to reach the bottoms of their cups they did vent some complaints about how little Hammond let them tackle, and his dislike for charging in off the cuff. A couple of stories unfolded that then reassured me when he did move, the Sheriff was a force to be reckoned with. I became doubly glad to have not incurred his wrath any further, and I deeply regretted taking issue with him in the first place. Before the bunch left they mentioned what they had come to Hammond for when our paths had crossed for the first time: I received no particulars but for a report of supernatural haunting behavior, as told by a widow on a range just outside the town. Hammond had tasked one of them to investigate come the morning, so I had only that long to do my own detective work. I figured if I put some thought towards the case, perhaps I could show the widow what she was really seeing was just sheets blowing in the sundown wind. Then I might endear myself better to the Sheriff and perhaps even enlist his aid in the future. Wish me luck, Pa. You always did say I had a keen mind: I hope you were right.",
    "<h3>WIDOW BRADY</h3>",
    "I found the widow and her dusty farmstead easy enough. She was a hard-looking woman very much similar to what I remember of my Gram, and she looked at me with an untrusting eye until I told her what my business was about. After that she took to me with a shine and insisted I sit down with her for coffee and biscuits. Over the meal (which I welcomed, and thanked her proper for) she told me all about her troubles. The hauntings, she said, had begun a week previous, just as her son had left to go cattle-ranching. At the beginning of the witching hour (or so she said) a ghastly moaning would echo throughout the canyon. Worse, in the direction of the moaning a pale figure in the shape of a man could be seen distantly atop the ridge. She had waited at her front door with a shotgun but the figure never seemed to approach any closer. It was a harmful specter, she reasoned, an Injun angered by their settling of his land. I barely had to question whether I might stay the night before she agreed. I could tell despite being a hard woman, she was spooked.",
    "That night I awoke to the sound of a horrid wailing that made the hairs stand atop the back of my neck. I found the widow Brady already standing at the front door, stiff as a statue. I peered past her and indeed I saw a fluttering white figure from the direction of that awful sound. I confess for a moment I stood there transfixed, sure I was seeing an apparition of some sort–but no superstitious fool am I, so I set off towards it. That noise pursued me as I picked my footing up the dusty ridge, but I persevered. The closer I got the surer I was I would come upon some sorry fool wearing a sheet, and when the wailing cut off abruptly I was nearly certain. I crested the ridge and saw the illusion for what it was: a simple bed’s sheet caught on a gnarled sapling. The wind had blown it on and caught it there, too distant to be clearly picked out except at night when the moon shone through it. All this I explained to the widow when I brought her back the sheet, and in pieces I put together the circumstance.",
    "The widow Brady had been washing the clothes her son was to wear for his cattle-ranching and her own linens as well: she had been so overcome by the departure and the work to be done before his leaving that when a single sheet had blown off the line it was out of sight and out of mind as well. She was sorely relieved to hear the explanation and I rode out several hours later fuller of coffee as well as a tart I was glad to have waited for her to cook. Only on writing this account do I remember the wailing, but it may be all for good I did not bring it up to her. It seems most likely that harrowing noise was simply made by the canyon or the rocks or some such, and had existed before the sheet.",
    "<h3>A REWARD FROM THE SHERIFF</h3>",
    "I rode into the town feeling awful full of myself, and I strutted right towards the Sheriff’s Office. In hindsight I do expect he would have thrown me out if his recruits hadn’t seen me walking in. They said hello and asked about the haunting, and I did well to tell them. The Sheriff watched me keenly over his desk as I described the poor Widow Brady’s situation and the absolutely mundane cause, but when I finished he did not tear loose. I thought that a good sign. He spoke up to ask a few questions and seemed satisfied when I answered them, then fell silent. I held my own breath and waited. Soon the Sheriff gave his recruits a glance and they scrambled out of his office, then closed the door behind them. I suppose I must have looked like a dog ready to be whipped, but thankfully no blow ever fell. Instead, he handed down an opportunity to me.",
    "Sheriff Hammond explained to me that Silver Springs was a place that regularly came by issues like the widow Brady’s. He said he had received no less than a dozen reports of Wendigoes in the past year. Imagine, pa! Wendigoes! Like from the stories Uncle Jack used to scare me with when I was a young’n. I believe the Sheriff saw my derision and he must have known I was the right man for the job, because he revealed to me an entire list of unsolved mysteries his outfit was too taxed to handle. Maybe he thought to test my gumption by going on to mention I would receive no support, no reward and no accolades, but as a matter of fact this was just the opportunity I had traveled here for. I gave him my unconditional agreement and was almost out the door before he stopped me. I could hardly believe my ears, pa: he said that under the power vested in him as Sheriff of Silver Springs, he was naming me an honorary deputy. I did not care that he went on to say it would be a secret between us and of course he would have to deny it under scrutiny: I could hardly keep myself from whooping out loud. I made it to the street outside and was so overcome by providence I almost had to pray. Imagine, me! Praying! But that was the state I was in.",
    "This begun a series of small mysteries I will not mention in too much depth here. Suffice to say they all followed the same path the widow Brady’s troubles had trod: some perfectly ordinary occurrance had been seen through a superstitious eye and been made a hullabaloo where none belonged. One old grandfather’s pocketwatch had in fact begun to tick backwards, but not because of any kind of curse: the gears in it had just become worn. Blood-red water spewed from a pump because nearby shoveling had dislodged iron dust. And a strange man in a black suit who appeared at noon had just been a trick of the heat-haze. And of course, all these miraculous happenings stopped once I had set their mysteries to rest. The pocketwatch ticked the right way, the water turned crystal clear, and the man stopped showing up. These things passed with such little fanfare that I scarce should mention them but for how they led me to the real mystery I faced in Silver Springs. An account of that is to follow.",
    "<h3>THE BEGINNING OF THE END</h3>",
    "I should say that as much as my deductive skills grew, my popularity in the town shrank twice as fast. I assumed, perhaps foolishly, that the good people of Silver Springs would be only too happy to discover how they’d been mistaken, but not everyone I set right took the news well. I must admit I was not always correct with my initial guess, but I did in the end arrive at the truth. These small mishaps grew into a misunderstanding among the townsfolk: they called me “suspicious,” and I thought at first it was a compliment. After all, my suspicion of what they took as truth allowed me more often than not to set them right.",
    "But the name was not intended as a compliment. I discovered this fact in the midst of a small demonstration by a woman gunslinger: by the time I arrived she was demonstrating her skill and accuracy with a small pistol of the kind one might conceal in a pocket. As I stopped to watch she shot several bottles to pieces from across the street, and the crowd cheered. I was, of course, duly impressed–but I was used to showmen at this point, and I considered them mostly to be frauds. When she announced next she would shoot a hole through the center of a falling playing card, I knew her to be one of them. It didn’t take a brilliant mind to deduce her plan to toss a card with a hole already shot through, and I shared as much with the Sheriff’s recruits I’d found myself nearby. She tossed the card and fired… but when the card fell to the ground, no hole marked it. The crowd muttered and I had to shake my head. How could she fail to throw the right card? She tried again, and once more the card fell, untouched. She stared fiercely at the card as if she’d never failed to make the shot before, and I raised my voice to tell the crowd all about her trickery. Before I could manage more than a couple words, however, she put the pistol into its holster and tossed the card. In a flash three shots rang out and when the card fell, one perfect hole was cut through the middle. I was impressed despite myself by her adaptability, but before I could continue my explanation the crowd turned on me. They called me “suspicious” and for some reason seemed to blame me for the difficulty the woman had encountered! I would have argued my case, of course, but she seemed none too happy with me. Fraud or not, I deduced she couldn’t fail to shoot me, seeing as I was much larger than a card, and wisely retreated.",
    "I won’t lie to you, Pa, being vilified unfairly by the townspeople did aggrieve me. However, you didn’t raise a quitter. If anything I grew more determined after being mistreated in this manner. And that was what had me riding Daisy into a dusty ranch supposedly plagued by a creature known as the “goatsucker.”",
    "<h3>THE STAKEOUT</h3>",
    "I had told the Sheriff’s recruits that this particular investigation would have me gone for no more than a day’s time, and indeed I believed it. After all, every instance of supernatural animals I had looked into was, in the end, any combination of several misconceptions. And so when a hard-looking farmer with a rifle in his hand showed me the corpse of his best goat, I was prepared to treat it just the same. It was a thin, wasted nanny goat with a wound on its neck, and I knelt beside it confidently. “These holes in its neck, if you look closer…” and we looked closer. But instead of the ordinary bite wound I expected to uncover, we were left staring at a pair of dark holes pierced in the flesh of the goat’s neck. I must confess it had been quite some time since my initial guess had been so instantly disproved, and it left me shaken. However, I grew only more determined at this initial setback. Could it be a wound left by thorns, or small bullets? Could another wound have proved the truly fatal blow? Could the goat have been simply weak and frail, not “drained” as the monster was supposed to have done? All of these ideas were disproved one by one until I was left with only uncertainty in my mind. To make matters worse, further investigation uncovered a third hole slightly below the initial two. Not even a beast with enlarged canines could have perpetrated this assault.",
    "The farmer accompanied me for the initial part of my inspection, but soon left to tend to his other, living, animals. I do not blame him: even after two hours of inspecting the area I was left with more questions than I had possessed two hours previously. The dry wind had cleared away any tracks the perpetrator might have left, except for two prints that might have been left by a stray dog. This was the sum of my investigation, even after a further two hours. By this time night had begun to fall and the farmer found me once more. I was unable to tell him anything of much substance, but I fixed upon those tracks. I reassured his wife and his young son during the simple dinner they thoughtfully provided for me that this beast, whatever its origin, was likely to be a stray dog with oddly-shaped teeth. The farmer seeemd wholly unconvinced, but he chose not to trouble his family further. And I… for the first time, something was giving me pause. I redoubled my convictions and recommended a stakeout near his goats for later that night. We would see the beast for ourselves, mutt or something stranger.",
    "So it was, Ma and Pa, that the two of us crouched behind a stump overlooking the farmer’s goat pen. I know you will steel your heart reading this, Pa, but I must implore you to refrain from sharing this next account with Ma. I know despite her being aware of my safety, it will give her no end of fright. For anyone else who may have cause to read this, I encourage you to take these words to heart: not everything on God’s earth can be explained.",
    "<h3>EL CHUPACABRA</h3>",
    "The first sign we had of it was when the goats began to grow restless. They bleated and stamped, drawing inwards and huddling so close that they seemed almost one mass. The farmer and I scanne the horizon for the source of their distress, but the pale moon did not show us much. He checked his rifle once, twice, inspecting the shot to make certain it would serve. I swept my eyes from side to side, but found nothing at first. And then–",
    "It seemed like a dog, the way it moved. It was a thin and sickly thing, and it stopped near the farmer’s house to lower its head and sniff the ground. Then it drew towards the pen. He saw it soon after I did, and leveled his gun. “Just a dog,” I whispered to him. “Did I not say–”",
    "But it was no mutt. The closer it came, the clearer that was. No dog had a spine that articulated or that visible, more like a skeleton than a living creature of flesh and blood. No dog had spines like a lizard’s, folding and unfolding on its back. No dog drew its paws in the dusty ground and left great furrows behind. “Just a dog,” I repeated to myself more than to the farmer, half-believing the moon would reveal some new, comforting feature of the thing. But each step it took acted as a new refusal to be simple. To be explained. It was a true monster, like from one of Carlisle’s tales, and a great horror began to take hold of me. Beside me the farmer raised his rifle, and I began to feel some relief.",
    "And then the thing hissed.",
    "It hissed, low and feral, and something odd happened. The goats which had been nervously shoving against the walls of the pen ceased, even to bleat. They relaxed and stood immobile and docile as if unaware their predator drew closer by the second. Thankfully the farmer still had his wits about him: he rested his rifle on the stump and drew a bead. Slowly, he drew the hammer back. And as it clicked, the awful monster turned. The thing looked straight at us, and hissed once more. I felt a great horror overtake me, as if my spirit had finally come to terms with the reality of this thing. My lids fell halfway and my mind swam: before my eyes the creature seemed to grow, and when its mouth opened great horrible fangs dripped blood. It began to pad towards us, and beside me the rifle fell from the farmer’s slackened fingers.",
    "I knew this great horror was approaching us: I could see the thing as it grew closer, and yet I could not move so much as a finger. All I was able to do was clamp my eyes shut and hope. All I could do was pray to whomever might be listening–this thing could not be real.",
    "But when I opened my eyes, it was. And it was close, less than ten feet away, stalking closer. Its red eyes were on the farmer, and he did not move.“You can’t be real,” I breathed, not knowing if it was aloud or not. But either way the thing heard me, and its burning glare fixed me instead, like that of the devil upon some unfortunate soul. Indeed I did feel as if brimstone was upon me, but the farmer recovered. One shot rang out, narrowly missing one of the crooked ears on the beast. Then another, but the thing moved impossibly fast, springing to the side, and a puff of dust raised where it had stood. The god-awful thing pounced then, and gouged the farmer with its fetid claws. The rifle was riven in two and he groaned, clutching his sopping wounds. Then it turned to me.",
    "This would have been my end, I am sure, but for the shot that rang out above its head. It hissed again and crouched like it might spring, but one more shot clipped its paw. With a last hiss it sprang back and dashed off into the darkness just as Sheriff Hammond rode up pulling the bolt on his rifle. I am not ashamed to say that the strain of facing this creature immediately overcome me, and I fainted dead away.",
    "<h3>AFTERMATH</h3>",
    "It unfolded that I had the Sheriff’s recruits to thank for my timely rescue. They had become worried when I had failed to return, and had mentioned it to Sheriff Hammond. What led him to come out to my rescue I may never know, but I am certainly glad he did. As soon as I woke I searched him out, thanked him, and turned in my badge, so to speak. Not that I ever truly did receive one, but I expect he must have been just about to present me with one. No matter: I was through. My expedition to Silver Springs had been in the pursuit of proving tall tales were just that, but coming face to face with something I now consider a beast from Hell set me right. I come now back to you, Ma and Pa, to apologize. Carlisle still is no friend of mine, but I find I must change the statement I began these accounts with.",
    "Most supernatural things may be pure superstition, but there are some things on this world that man cannot explain."

    "We had him dead to rights, you know. Simon had plunged his lance through the thing's rotten ribcage and Alan had just smashed the pendant he held his life in. Zara had summoned licks of flame that were eating him alive: all he had time for was a single, last-ditch effort. A pointed finger, a rasped word, and a ray of something purple that turned my flesh near to ice when it passed me by. I had the gall to feel a sense of satisfaction until I heard a stifled gasp behind me. Until I heard the fading laugh from our mortal enemy and turned to see the look of glassy-eyed shock on Anastasia's face. She fell almost soundlessly and when I caught hold of her she weighed less than a feather. She was gone.",
    "I don't remember much of what happened next. There are small moments, flitting memories I can grasp hold of, lasting only until the inescapable horror of my Ana's death chased me back into darkness. Eventually my companions left me--they must have. Alone in the Death King's empty castle I awoke one day to find the food my friends had left for me rotting, the water spoiled. I scavenged what I could from the castle's stores and made do. At first I resented them for returning without me, but I soon forgave them: Simon was a prince and surely now would be made king. Alan had made a promise to his lover, that he'd settle down with her when he was done. Zara wanted to travel the world. And Ana, my Ana--<br>Only I had no reason to return. What good is a hero when evil has been vanquished? He's at best a mercenary, at worst a pawn. Every kingdom in the world would secretly wish to see me dead, perhaps even the one I chose to support. And whichever I did would fling itself into battle thinking they possessed the ultimate soldier.",
    "I could have returned, fulfilled my Ana's wish: a safe home for her fragmented little family. But the thought of seeing hope disappear from her little brother's innocent face, her father's tortured expression when he discovered his daughter's fate... I found myself retching, heaving up nothing at all. I would rather die here, I decided, deep in the Death King's lair. It was only fitting, since my Ana had done so.",
    "It was a curious thing, but with every passing day her body failed to deteriorate. After what must have been a month her skin was still soft, a glow still present on her features. Every day I tested her pulse and every day I convinced myself anew I'd merely missed it the day prior. And each day I found nothing but the stillness of the grave. Each day I tore myself from her limp body and escaped into the winding passageways of the castle, wishing to simply disappear. Instead I must have pressed a stone in the wall or found the right cobble to step on, for one day a door opened for me that had been plain stone before. Inside was a vast library of deathly secrets, forbidden knowledge that must have made the Death King who he was. And so, little by little, I began to read. A hope burning faintly in my breast, the soft muted warmth of my Ana.",

		"He heard it first along the waves, and he thought the heat of the sun might be getting to him. Thomas knew the song: had sung it this voyage, just yesterday, in fact--and now it was reflected back to him in an echo. The birds it was, perhaps, seagulls crying in a way his mind had misinterpreted. Or the wind, or the waves, or simple lightheadedness. As his skipper skimmed slow along the sea he dipped his head in the cool water, felt it drag, opened his eyes to see the sun glimmering off fish scales, to see a not-so-distant face--<br>Thomas jerked upright, hair bedraggled, wide-eyed and disbelieving. He pulled the sail and slowly, cautiously, dipped his head beneath the waves. With all the care of a man putting his head in a lion's maw. Again, the fish, again the deep blue sea, but this time no slender face. And though he remained at that spot for a time before furling his sails and turning back, he didn't hear the song again that day.",
		"He didn't hear it the next day, for he remained silent. It had been an echo, then, or something like it: he felt certain the truth had outed. The next day he would sing.",
		"He heard it second on the placid sea, perhaps a half hour closer to his home. This time he took in the sails and listened more closely, only to find there had been an error in translation. He let the melody go until he couldn't stand it any longer, opening his mouth and underlining the correct notes in his baritone boom. Out across the waves his correction flew, and for a long moment wasn't returned. Thomas began to think he had imagined the whole thing after all, but then--<br>~♪♫<br>Thomas nodded to himself, satisfied. And when other small imperfections appeared he corrected them as well, overwriting the melody that was then echoed, correctly.",
		"He heard it third in a great storm, in a maelstrom sprung up without warning or sense. It cut through the blue-green frothing waves as he thrashed within them, and most unlike an echo it grew in volume. He had a gallon of seawater in him by the time what felt like soft hands buoyed him, bore him to his boat, and his sense was too far gone to recognize the speed of his craft on the return. ",
		"He heard it fourth days later, recovered from the storm. The sound the echo made seemed joyous, or perhaps nervous. He sang at the same time, the same pitch, no longer believing it was a mere seabird or reverberation from the glassy sea. He sang the final verse and immersed his head in the deep blue.<br>He heard it fifth under the water, trilling and sweet, and he watched as the singer approached. Slender, ethereal, snakelike. Glittering scales like a gorgeous, rainbow fish. Warmed, suntanned skin.",
		"He heard it sixth by the sand's edge, and seventh on the rocks. Then he didn't hear it for some time--for after all, they had learned new songs to sing. But he would hear it again on warm days over the glassy sea, and on nights, hummed softly, under the covers of his bed."

		"Magic wasn't magic if you could see it from the wings. Out there in the half-lit booths, around the tables heaped with wineglasses, Nathan was sure it was more impressive to see a rose appear from nowhere. To see a card revealed--the right card, the chosen card. From the wings on the side of the stage, Nathan saw a different kind of show. He saw the rose slipped out of the magician's pocket a moment earlier, and the card swapped out halfway through the shuffle. He saw the force, the palm, the ditch, the load. He saw the trick for what it was, and felt...<br>disappointed.",
		"It was a silly emotion to feel, almost childish. Of course magic wasn't real: rabbits didn't simply appear inside hats. They came from somewhere and likely went somewhere as well. You couldn't break the laws of nature. Only one magician had ever done that.",
		"Nathan watched from the sidelines, staring with a grim expression on his face as the magician on stage wowed the audience. \"The Day of the Dead! A spine-chilling, liminal occasion when the lines between the living and the dead...\" his patter continued, but Nathan tuned it out. Tonight's entertainment was themed and the magicians had been coached to alter their acts accordingly. Not, of course, that most did more than the bare minimum: the current act had just withdrawn a deck of cards with a smiling skull on it. Well, that was fine if the crowd enjoyed it--and they did, after all, clapping and cheering when the ace of spades was produced once, twice, three times despite having been shuffled back into the deck after each reveal. Nathan watched the magician's hands and nodded to himself, satisfied, when he saw the card deftly slipped from the bottom of the deck.",
		"He knew it was stupid, that he wanted at once to be fooled by a magic trick yet watched so doggedly to discern its methodology. Nathan couldn't stand not knowing, even though the subsequent feeling of satisfaction was utterly and completely drowned out by disappointment. As a child he'd pored over the books in the local library (later, internet forums and still later, online encyclopedias) for insight into stage magic. Now, he hardly had to think to figure out the most convoluted acts.<br>All but one.",
		"The crowd cheered as the magician revealed his final trick: a sugar skull from his black stovepipe hat. Nathan did his best not to roll his eyes, but he couldn't quite paste on a smile as the performer exited the stage. Sweaty, he grinned at Nathan and offered a hand. \"Did I fool you?\"<br>The technician shook his hand and smirked for a second or two, no more. \"The ace never got shuffled back into the deck. False bottom on the hat.\"<br>The magician's smile faltered but returned as he mopped his brow. \"And the ribbons?\"<br>Nathan frowned. He hadn't seen that. Must have tuned out for a little too long. \"Wadded up... hidden in the palm?\" The man's fallen face was all the answer he needed. \"Hey, you still get paid. Just not the extra.\"<br>\"Still!\" The magician cried, dramatic on stage and off. \"It's the spirit of the matter. I'll just have to fool you next time.\"<br>\"Next time,\" he agreed, and handed an envelope over. Just one, not the bill fold in his pocket. Large and growing larger every show he wasn't tricked. But before the man could leave Nathan spoke. As if it was an afterthought:<br>\"If you had to make a person disappear... really, truly disappear, how would you do it?\"<br>The magician considered that. \"A trap door,\" he answered at last. \"And something soft below.\"<br>But it hadn't been a stage. And the backyard of a boy's tenth birthday party wasn't likely to have trap doors built into it. \"Ever known a magician to wear a checkered blue suit?\"<br>\"Hmm... not so far as I can recall. Friend of yours?\"<br>\"Something like that,\" Nathan said, and nodded a goodbye.<br>At least the magician had the good manners not to count the money until he was out of view.",
		"Nathan stifled a sigh as the next performer went on stage. Nonstop magic. It brought the crowds in.",
		"This man wasn't nearly as much a stereotype as the last one had been, Nathan had to admit that. Instead of a black suit and tie, he wore a white collared shirt and a bolo. Instead of a scrawny, intense-looking white guy, the magician was Mexican, probably. Nathan liked that. Diversity meant new tricks. \"The great,\" an announcer's voice boomed, \"Ernestooo!\"<br>Ernesto smiled, gave a cocky bow, and began his patter. Nathan tuned it out.",
		"Instead of listening, he was thinking again about the cheers of children, the taste of frosting on his tongue. Little Sally walking casually up to the magician with the big smile, his checkered blue suit shimmering in the sunlight. Him waving his palm over her straw-blonde hair and then--",
		"Nathan frowned. He had been watching the performance out of the corner of his eye and something had brought him up short, something that he didn't immediately understand. He watched more closely: as he did, the magician's hand passed in front of his face. In a flash, his visage was overlaid with skull imagery, like a mask in the style of a sugar skull. The hand passed in front: gone. Again: the mask returned. It took a moment for Nathan to understand why something was continuing to nag at him while he watched the performance--but as the magician dipped in a bow to the pleased cheers of his audience, it hit him. Nathan didn't know how he'd done the trick.<br>Was it a sliding mask trick? He wore no hat. Was it a light trick? They didn't have the right lights or projectors for that. It had to be, he ended up deciding, a very good sleight-of-hand trick. A very, very good one.",
		"Then his assistant, pretty in her sugar-skull makeup, wheeled out the saw-in-half prop. More patter that Nathan tuned out: he'd heard it all before. Perhaps the so-called \"Great Ernesto\" would say something about how all of this was perfectly safe, or how he possessed healing powers sufficient to close up his assistant after she was split in half. He waved a sharp-looking saw and spun the twin boxes the assistant was already lying in, revealing to the audience there was nothing up his sleeves. Nathan had seen it all before: two assistants would be involved, pressed together to pretend they were just one, and so the saw would go straight between. The large metal bowl below where her stomach was supposed to be was new, but he couldn't imagine the act would catch his attention.",
		"Nathan was wrong.",
		"The first inkling he got came when the gag was placed in the woman's mouth. It seemed like a slightly macabre gesture but then again, this was for a Day of the Dead act so he could let it pass as an off-color joke. The woman looked around wildly as the saw was placed between the boxes and caught his eyes. She looked terrified: all her showmanship and bravado had disappeared in a very convincing way that, in his mind, elevated this mediocre act to a good one. Still, Nathan wished she'd at least look at the audience. There was no point in looking scared for his benefit.<br>Nathan wrinkled his nose as red syrup began to drip down from the sawing and puddle in the metal bowl. Even for Day of the Dead this was a little far. He was going to cut the act but realized belatedly the angle of the prop boxes made it so the bowl--and the blood beginning to fill it--was only visible from the wings. None of the audience seemed to have noticed, so Nathan relaxed. A little.<br>Then the entrails began to spill.<br>Convincing, realistic prop guts spilled out and dropped into the metal bowl with a wet squelch. They shivered as the assistant struggled, her eyes wide and uncomprehending. He could hear the muffled noises she was making and to be honest, they began to unnerve him. The saw had reached halfway down her now and the tone of it changed: from a wet ripping noise every time the saw dragged one way to a rough grating. Not unlike metal on bone. The magician leaned down, forcing the saw through--a snap. The last few inches. Guts and entrails, feet and feet of them, went splattering into the bowl. Red droplets spilled onto the ground. The assistant blinked slowly. Thrashed weakly. Died.<br>Pretended to die, that is. She pretended. Nathan needed to snap out of it.",
		"\"But on this day, el Dia de Los Muertos,\" Ernesto crowed, \"Even the dead may return to life.\" His face was sweaty underneath the stage lights and he grinned like a madman. \"Even this woman may be joined together again!\" The magician waved his hand over the box and slowly, very slowly the entrails--the fake entrails--began to slide back up. The assistant began to thrash and make gutteral noises, almost inaudible past the gag. They were drowned out by a horrible cracking and stitching sound as the damage began to reverse itself. Little by little. One foot of the intestinal rope by one foot. And somehow, inexplicably, the blood even began to slither upwards. The corn syrup? The blood?<br>When the process was fully reversed it was like it had never happened at all: not a speck of red was visible, not even on the saw which Ernesto waved to raucous applause. The assistant was removed from the box and displayed without any trace of damage to her person, although she was clearly unsteady. Clearly dazed. Clearly changed.",
		"Nathan didn't pay attention to the rest of the act, not that there was much left to miss. In the end the assistant departed the stage and so did the magician, leaving him face to face with Nathan, who came back to himself with a start. He realized the magician must have been talking to him for some time.<br>\"Sorry,\" Nathan replied automatically. \"What was that?\"<br>\"Oh, Just asking if you liked the show.\" Ernesto was still grinning wide, too wide for Nathan's comfort. Up close he could see that several of Ernesto's teeth were golden. His skin still glistened in the cool air of the wings, away from the bright stage lights.<br>\"Yes.\"<br>\"Just a simple yes?\" the magician laughed as if enjoying some joke Nathan wasn't privy to. \"I was certainly hoping you'd have a stronger reaction, ese! I pulled out some of my best tricks.\" He leaned close, conspiratorially, smelling strongly of sage. \"Did I fool you?\"<br>Nathan found he couldn't swallow: his throat was too dry. He answered mechanically. \"Sleight of hand on the masks. And for the saw...\" he hesitated, then swore at himself for doing so. It was a simple trick. He'd seen it a million times before. This one had simply involved some unorthodox props. \"For the saw,\" he coughed, \"two women, just like how it's always done. One woman is the legs, the other...\"<br>\"The top?\" Ernesto nodded, contemplating the answer. \"Yes, that's how it's done. You're a bright one, ese! Then the legs must be in there still.\" Nathan followed the magician's pointing finger to the saw box prop. When had that gotten there? The box intended for the top was open, empty. The bottom was closed.<br>\"Yes,\" Nathan answered quietly. \"She must be.\"<br>\"Likes spending her time in there, doesn't she?\" Ernesto gave him a serious look, then clapped him on the shoulder and burst into laughter. It was all Nathan could do to smile wanly. \"Ah, I kid. She's in there. You guessed me right, ese.\"<br>\"Of course.\" He tried to put as much certainty into the words as possible. He doled out the cash, which Ernesto graciously accepted, and the magician turned to leave. \"One last thing,\" Nathan added, kicking himself internally. He'd spoken by reflex but wanted absolutely nothing more to do with this man. Every cell in his body was screaming to leave. He licked his lips as he felt the magician's eyes--and his smile--on him. \"If... if you were going to make an assistant disappear in broad daylight, how would you do it?\"<br>The man seemed to consider that for a moment. Finally he grinned and tossed back over his shoulder: \"Well, ese, I suppose I'd have to send her somewhere else.\"",
		"His laughter faded down the wing, leaving Nathan's skin crawling. He knew very little about anything, he often felt, besides magic. And this was what he knew: on a muggy summer day on a child's eleventh birthday, little Sally had gone forever and he'd never seen her again.",
		"And when he opened the last box he knew one more thing:<br>magic was real."

		"It was a strange sight, six beautiful girls sitting at a table in a run-down little restaurant. They were supremely out of place in such a shabby diner: each in their own way looked as if she could have been a supermodel, or on the front page of some fashion magazine, or on the television--something bright and clean and high-profile. The other patrons, mostly sweat-stained men and the odd strung-out woman, stared openly at the six. The girls didn't seem to care: they only had eyes for the young man bringing their drinks. They shot a few remarks his way and giggled as he fumbled his way through a response, and still their eyes followed him when he left to bus the other tables. Only one of the girls seemed at all able to tear her gaze away from him, and she turned back to her friends with an incredulous expression on her face.",
		"\"Him?! Really?\"",
		"The girl next to her rolled her eyes and drummed her glitter-coated pink nails on her jeweled phone. \"Mika, don't be such a bummer. What's not to like?\"",
		"Mika turned and watched the busboy delivering waters to another table. She looked him up and down one more time: black, close-cropped hair... not tall, not short... uniform not well fitted... face neither ugly nor particularly remarkable at all. He just seemed... normal. Kind of boring.",
		"\"I just, he looks...\" Mika searched for words, frowning when she discovered she'd already forgotten his unremarkable face. Perhaps it was no surprise she hadn't recognized him from their school. \"Kind of average? I don't know. I always thought you went for older guys, Rina.\"",
		"Rina blew a kiss towards the busboy and smirked when he blushed and stumbled, nearly losing the glasses and plates he carried. \"Yeah, y'know, I used to, I did, but he's different.\" She stuck her tongue out at Mika when she continued to stare with an incredulous expression, prompting the girl to round on another of her friends.",
		"\"And you, Keiko? I thought you were...\" she lowered her voice and leaned in, glancing around. Some of their onlookers had the good nature to look away. \"...were, you know... interested in girls, not guys.\"",
		"The girl she addressed flinched back slightly, a blush coloring her pale cheeks. She swept a hand through her long black hair and bit her lip, looking almost embarrassed. \"Yeah, normally... but I don't know, there's just something about him. You really don't see it?\"",
		"All eyes turned back to the busboy. Still Mika couldn't see it, but they could all see the disaster before it started: a stray shoelace, a platter of (thankfully empty) plates and the rest was history. He went sprawling and plates shattered all over the dirty floor. A chorus of sucked-in breaths and gasps echoed around the girls' table. Mika almost started towards him to see if he needed help but he was already standing up on his own--only to come face to face with a livid manager. His scolding could be heard from every seat in the diner. The patrons turned back to their business, seemingly used to the spectacle.",
		"\"What a klutz,\" one of the girls snickered, and Mika rounded on her. ",
		"\"Exactly! Who even trips on their own shoelaces? Nel--\"",
		"But Nel was already shaking her hand, eyes warm behind her glasses and overlong bangs. \"Don't get me wrong! I think it's charming. He's so uncoordinated!\" She smiled at the busboy, now apologizing to his manager, and shrugged when she caught Mika's stare. \"What? It is.\"",
		"\"Emma,\" Mika started, but stopped as soon as she saw the moony expression on her friend's face. \"You too?\"",
		"Emma blushed and nodded her head slowly. She was half-hidden behind her school books, but her eyes visibly tracked the young man's every movement. She caught her breath and blew it out in one long, slow puff. \"M... me too.\"",
		"\"You know,\" the sixth girl leaned back against the diner seats, arms folded behind her head. \"That clumsiness is actually how we met the first time around. If he wasn't the way he is, I might still be indulging my bad boy craving.\" There was murmured assent around the table, but Mika was happy to take the bait.",
		"\"How did the you meet him, Ally? In fact--how did all of you meet?\"",
		"\"Well,\" Ally drawled, \"I was driving my bike down the street when he stepped on his shoelace and pitched right into the road. Almost rolled right over him.\" Several of the girls shuddered. Emma let out a muffled shriek. \"Anyway, he was fine. I stopped in time, but I had a mind to tan his hide.\" She paused, long enough that Mika gestured for her to continue on. \"Well...\" Ally coughed, the brash girl seeming almost embarrassed. \"I didn't. We, uh, started talking, and he said he knew what it was like to lose a parent...\"",
		"This time Mika did interrupt. \"He knew about your dad?\"",
		"\"What? No way!\" Ally shook her head. \"We just talked and the conversation sorta... went that way. And he made me feel better, and I figured why the hell not, I could go for a normal guy once in a while. You're always telling me to.\"",
		"Mika looked ready to interject, or at least to push for more information, but her friends were jostling to share their own stories. \"It was like that for me too y'know,\" Rina mentioned after she finished blowing a pink, bubblegum bubble. \"Like, I was out taking the subway and I just happened to look up from my phone, and he was just about to walk off the platform right onto the rails! I yelled and he stopped, like, just in time. Super lucky.\" Emma let out another gasp but Rina just flicked her hair and rolled her eyes. \"A-nyway, we chatted up a bit and I gave him my number and we've been texting ever since. I don't know, he was just a really good listener, and I kinda needed it after I messed up my midterms so bad. He showed me a pic of his midterms and he got two points lower than me, lol.\"",
		"The girls turned to watch as the object of their affections dusted himself down and began to pick up the broken pieces of the plates he'd dropped. \"Shouldn't we help him, or something?\" Mika muttered, but Nel shook her head.",
		"\"It's his job,\" she said as she blew the bangs from in front of her eyes. \"I tried to help last time I was in here, but he just got yelled at more. 'Now you're making the customers pick up your slack,' yadda yadda. But we talked a little when his manager wasn't looking.\" A simple, peaceful smile spread over her face as she reminisced. \"He really got me, y'know? Not everyone does. Almost no one does, actually, but he knew just what to say.\" Mika snorted slightly, but found to her surprise each one of her friends was nodding along to that statement as if it perfectly summed up their experience. And one by one, each of their stories followed the same pattern:",
		"Emma relayed how he'd dropped a bunch of books in the library right in front of her and when they'd talked, she'd found a kindred spirit in him to discuss obscure philosophers with.",
		"Keiko shared how he'd missed an important goal kick and cost her the soccer game, but then the two of them had mutually confided their career woes.",
		"\"This is nuts,\" Mika said after she'd heard it all. \"Some guy bumps into all of you and just happens to know exactly what's wrong? Just happens to have the same issues going on or--or knows the same random things you're into? He sounds too good to be true.\"",
		"She was expecting some kind of realization or distress from her friends... but instead Mika was bombarded by laughter. Even Emma giggled behind her books. \"Too good to be true is right!\" Rina smirked. \"Like, would he have all of us interested in him if he wasn't?\" And more laughter.",
		"\"You like him too or something?\" Keiko asked. \"Because I think 5 of us is enough.\"",
		"And they laughed, and they laughed, and they laughed.",
		"At the end of it all, Mika was left staring in mixed confusion and horror--exacerbated by the carefree expressions on her friends' faces. They had straightaway shifted into gossip and chatter, all with a singular focus... their new object of affection. Mika tried to steer the conversation once, twice, but to no avail: it really seemed like the girls didn't have any interest in talking about anything else. Mika stood up all at once, biting her lip and blinking quickly. \"Well,\" she bit out, \"I'm going to head home.\"",
		"\"Oh?\" Ally pulled herself away from some story about the boy. \"Lotsa homework?\"",
		"\"That's right,\" Mika nodded, forcing a smile. \"I'll see you all in class.\"",
		"They waved her goodbye and she walked out, feeling absolutely sick to her stomach. She was so focused she almost walked right into the topic of her friends' conversation: with a \"whoa!\" and a general clatter, the two ended up in a tangle by the alley beside the diner. Mika picked herself up first and found the third casualty of their collision: a collection of boxes and empty bottles. Mika bent down to help him collect them, casting a suspicious glare as she did. Although she looked him up and down again, once more she couldn't find anything amiss about him. He looked apologetic enough, which only made her more annoyed. He started to say \"sorry\", and she snapped.",
		"\"Oh, skip it. I ran into you, not the other way around.\" She glared at him, half expecting a sharp retort... but just got a smile in response. His voice was soft when she heard it, and calm.",
		"\"Rough day?\"",
		"Mika blinked, then set a frown on her face again. She picked up a box and righted it. \"Yeah, I guess.\"",
		"\"I get that.\" He nodded and picked one up beside her. \"I'm having a bad day too. Did you see me drop those plates?\"",
		"\"I did.\"",
		"\"I noticed,\" he said at last, \"you were about to get up and help me before Nel stopped you. I wanted to thank you for that.\"",
		"\"Oh.\" Mika blinked. \"Well, you're welcome. I didn't help after all--\"",
		"\"But you were going to. That means something.\"",
		"\"Yeah, I guess.\"",
		"They'd reassembled half of the boxes now. A couple passerby paused to watch them, but no one helped. Why should they? It wasn't their problem.",
		"\"Tell you the truth,\" he grunted as they stacked the boxes, \"I was having a rough day before the plates.\"",
		"\"Oh?\"",
		"\"Yeah. My friends got into this new thing that I don't even understand and...\"",
		"He trailed off, fully absorbing himself in picking up the bottles, now that the boxes had been righted. Despite herself Mika pressed further. \"And?\"",
		"\"And it's like they're not my friends anymore,\" he sighed. \"Honestly, I don't even recognize them these days.\"",
		"\"Yeah, I get that.\" And she did. I'm losing them to you, she thought but didn't say.",
		"\"I don't know. It's stupid, I guess,\" he chuckled. \"Maybe I'm the one changing.\"",
		"\"No way,\" she said, temper flaring. \"If they're all changing without you, that's not what friends do. If they're leaving you out? Maybe you're better... without them.\"",
		"She spent a long moment picking up bottles, head turned down and face hidden. He gave her the time. Then, \"I guess you're right. It's just hard to lose them, you know? After so long.\"",
		"\"So long,\" she agreed, and bit off the rest. Those five had been her friends for so, so long. And now was it just going to be like this from now on? For a stupid boy? This stupid boy, she reminded herself. He was the problem.",
		"\"It's not forever, though.\" He said it so sudden--or maybe she was so caught in her thoughts--she looked up in surprise and caught him smiling. What was it about his expression? It was at once tender and sad, flush with a secret hurt that she understood. That maybe only she also understood. \"It's not going to be forever,\" he reiterated, and something about his tone made her almost feel like he knew it was the truth. \"We've had problems before, and we'll have others in the future. I think we'll look back at this in a year and laugh, you know?\"",
		"\"Yeah... yeah, you're right.\" Now that she thought about it, he absolutely was. They'd all had their disagreements before, but the six of them were inseparable. Split apart by a stupid boy? No way! They'd be back to normal in a week. Ally would find some biker guy, Keiko's eye would get caught by a girl in her sports team, Emma would go back to burying her nose in a book... it would be alright.",
		"They'd collected all the boxes, all the bottles. The two of them stood and dusted themselves off. \"I can't thank you enough for this,\" he sighed. \"Maybe now my manager won't yell so much at me.\"",
		"\"Sure,\" she shrugged. \"It was my fault, anyway.\"",
		"\"Actually, I think it was mine.\"",
		"\"It was mine.\"",
		"\"It was--\" he stopped at her sudden faux glare. \"Fine,\" he laughed. \"It was both of our fault.\"",
		"\"I'll take it.\" She nodded and started away, giving him a casual wave. Maybe he was right. Maybe everything would turn out just fine and her friends would go back to normal. Maybe they'd be laughing and chatting just like always in--she didn't know, maybe a week. Two weeks at the most. At least he didn't seem too bad of a guy. Actually, he'd been really helpful. Maybe that was why everyone liked him so much. She could see it--almost see it. Maybe it was the way his eyes lit up when he smiled, or the way she could see something deeper, something just little painful behind the expression.<br>She smiled without even knowing it as she went walking down the street, kicking a rock in front of her as she thought of him. The clumsy busboy.",

    "The nurse peered around the hospital room, doing her best to look past the handsome man in the invalid's bed. He leaned back, unbandaged arm behind his head, seemingly without a care in the world. She didn't like how his eyes roved over her, didn't like the way her nurse's gown seemed no impediment to his gaze. Or she did like it, and didn't like that she liked it. \"Something wrong?\" he asked, and she gave a little start. The nurse reached up to tuck a lock of hair behind her ear but stopped herself halfway. \"No, nothing. I just thought I heard someone in here.\" She frowned at the open window with its fluttering drapes and started towards it but he held up a hand: \"Please, I like the fresh air.\" A smile curved his full lips. \"It can be our little secret.\" Despite herself, the nurse flushed. She had already spent longer here than she intended. She had her rounds to do. \"Fine,\" she said as curtly as she could manage. \"But no more getting out of bed, Mr. Emry. By all rights, you shouldn't even be alive.\" She'd hoped the sentiment would wipe that devil-may-care expression off his face but it had done the opposite: he seemed cockier, almost. Like he was pleased to be reminded of how close he'd come to shuffling off this mortal coil. The nurse pushed herself along, forcing her legs to move. She realized belatedly that one of her hands was toying with a fold of her scrubs and tugged it away, furiously blushing.",
    "In the bed the man turned slowly, nonchalantly, back to the window. \"Did you hear that?\" he whistled low and long. \"Shouldn't even be alive.\" He cast a grin at the woman sitting on the windowsill, her white wings haloed by the light. Her beautiful but austere face didn't betray so much as a hint of a smile. \"This is no laughing matter,\" she said as harshly as the tinkling bells of her voice could allow. \"She's right: people don't survive what you survived.\" Her eyes flicked over the cast around his arm, itself merely a formality. It was an overreaction to a simple sprain, but the doctors would have felt remiss not doing something at least. \"I must be the luckiest man alive then, to have such a beautiful angel checking in on me.\" But his flattery washed right off her. \"This is no laughing matter.\" Her eyes flashed and her wings flapped, sending the drapes fluttering towards him. \"You were meant to die.\" \"Meant to die...\" he considered the idea, but didn't seem overly concerned by it. \"I guess your people made a mistake.\" The light in the hospital room dimmed: perhaps a cloud passed in front of the sun. Perhaps a cold wind blew through the window. Perhaps the suddenly-flickering fluorescent hospital lights were what made her features seem so sharp. \"We are the Kingdom of Heaven,\" the angel bit out. \"We don't make mistakes.\" \"And yet I'm not dead. So someone did,\" he remarked mildly, and after a moment or two the room returned to normal: the cloud passed from in front of the sun, the wind quieted and the fluorescent lights resumed their uninterrupted hum. \"Is it so hard to believe someone up there--in their infinite wisdom--made an error?\" He waved his uninjured hand nonchalantly. \"What's the alternative? I made a deal with the Devil to cheat death?\" She stared at him with her piercing blue eyes, flax-golden hair almost glittering in the sunlight. He met her gaze for a moment or two, then burst out laughing. \"Sorry. Bad joke.\" \"Very bad,\" she agreed, and meant it.",
    "\"Although, I'd have to say it would be a good trade.\" The angel looked at him, at the man in the hospital bed, her expression severe. \"My soul, for meeting you?\" He whistled. \"I'd do it again.\" Not so much as a quirk of her lips was betrayed on her angelic face, but it didn't seem to bother him any. \"All of your jokes are bad,\" she snipped, and he grinned. \"So you're learning!\"<br>But it hadn't sounded like a joke. It hadn't sounded like a joke at all."

		"Elijah Wesson stood stiffly in the Police Chief's office, looking every bit the new recruit he was. Chief Lester, first and last name offered on the plaque on his desk, muttered into his rotary phone and took sips from his rapidly-cooling coffee. Elijah ignored the repeated flicks of the Chief's eyes: \"sit down\", he mouthed, but gave up when the recruit just shook his head. At last the phone call finished. He set down the receiver and shuffled papers around on his desk. \"Elijah. Mind if I call you Eli?\"",
    "\"Prefer not, sir,\" the recruit replied. \"Elijah is the name my father gave me and if it's all the same, I'll keep it.\"",
    "\"Best if you learn to relax,\" the chief remarked mildly, but just shrugged when Elijah lapsed back into silence. \"Well, suit yourself. A little prim-and-proper might do your partner some good. He's--\"",
    "And then the door to the police office swung open and Max Hardgrove walked in.<br>Heads turned. Eyes widened. The handsome dame at the third desk blushed and bit her lip. Max Hardgrove, six feet tall minus his half-cocked trilby, had that effect. He ignored it as he swept into the Chief's office. A cigarette glowed between his fingers and he tapped the ash onto the carpeted floor, earning him a disgusted glare from Elijah. He scratched at the 5-o'clock shadow on his chin and growled out the following: \"Max Hard, at your service. Now make it quick.\"",
    "Elijah's eyes flashed. He opened his mouth to chastise the detective--no matter who he thought he was--but was cut off and startled by the Chief suddenly slamming a fist down on his desk. \"Dammit Max,\" he roared, \"you're lucky I'm letting you keep your badge after what you pulled last week!\"",
    "The detective took a long drag from his cigarette and blew the smoke towards the ceiling. \"Tell me, Chief, are the robbers gone or not?\"",
    "\"That's not--\" the Chief began, his face turning red, but Max just interrupted him before he could get going. \"Cut to the chase, Chief. You called me away from the big case. What's so important, another triple homicide? They shut down the banks?\"",
    "\"You're getting a partner, Max,\" the Chief slammed his desk again, \"and that's final!\" Someone needs to keep an eye on your loose cannon ways. This is Elijah, and he's a rising star. Follows the rules, a legal eagle! You could stand to learn a thing or two from him.\"",
    "For a long moment no one spoke. Elijah had almost recovered from the abrupt shift in tone when Max flicked his cigarette to the floor and ground it out with his heel. \"Fine\", he growled out. \"I quit.\" The detective pulled out his badge and unholstered his six-shooter, then slammed them down on the Chief's desk. The impact rattled his coffee cup and jangled his rotary phone, as well as sent the plaque bearing simply \"The Chief\" falling face-down.",
    "Max turned, his trenchcoat whipping in a wind Elijah hadn't noticed, and strode to the door. Good riddance, the greenhorn thought, frankly infuriated by everything about this detective. But to his surprise, Max never made it out. \"Hold it,\" the Chief shouted, his knuckles white as he gripped his desk. \"Max, Goddammit but you're the best we've got. No partner, you just keep on fighting the good fight. Now get over here and grab your damn badge.\"",
    "Elijah watched incredulously as Max, expression unflinchingly grim, strode back to scoop up his possessions. He didn't seem surprised by the outcome; far from it, he acted like he'd known this would happen all along. It heated Elijah's blood and he opened his mouth to say something--anything--but couldn't push the words out. It was like trying to speak through cement. But finally he managed one word: \"No.\"",
    "Both the Chief and the detective turned to face him, and he wasn't sure who looked more surprised. Elijah's face flushed but he pushed on: luckily, the words came easier after the first. \"You heard the Chief. I'm your partner from now on. Those are the rules. And besides, detectives have to work in pairs. Policy.\" ",
    "The Chief spluttered, finally stammering out \"Now kid, I know you don't know who this is, but...\" his words trailed off as Max held up a hand. Elijah had been watching his expression: until he recovered, the detective had looked absolutely, positively shocked. Far more than the circumstances should afford. But he regained his composure and a wind blew through again from somewhere, stirring his coat. He'd plucked out another lit cigarette at some point. Elijah wasn't sure how he'd missed it happen.",
    "\"What's your name, kid?\" Max asked, and got a frown in return. The Chief had introduced him already, hadn't he? \"Elijah Wesson,\" he answered. \"Eli Watson,\" Max repeated, and nodded to himself. \"A good pair of names. Alright, I'll make an exception just this once. Come with me and I'll explain our case on the way.\" And without further fanfare he swept out of the room. Eli looked back at the Chief and then went hurrying after.",
    "\"My name,\" Eli began as he caught up to the detective, \"my name...\" but he couldn't quite remember what he'd been trying to say. Something about his father. Something important. He shook his head and abandoned the topic, looking back instead at the office: \"The Chief went crazy when you walked in. I guess he awas giving me the good cop treatment.\" He noticed the Chief setting his desk back up, cup and phone and plaque, which read \"David Lester\"--just like it always had. Hadn't it?",
    "Something felt wrong to Elijah--Eli. To Eli Watson. Something felt very wrong, but he just couldn't figure out what.",

    "The fire crackled, and the wine flowed. We four traded stories and laughter after another successful fight, although of course we hadn't contributed much. Alexander asked the question that set all this in motion, although of course there could have been signs far before--and perhaps if we'd been more watchful we would have seen them.

We were only too glad to follow suit (Alexander blamed it on the Gorgon's wine) but Diana began to worry.

		"He had been walking through the snow for eight hours, and had made several observations he could be sure of: after about an hour, one's legs began to burn. After four hours, all feeling went out of them. And after seven, one tended to lose track of time. The man in the cloak trudged on, carving dual trenches through the snow as soft flakes drifted down. Magic could solve all three of these problems, and he knew the spells: perhaps a strengthening enchantment for the legs, or a spell to quicken the blood. Perhaps a conjured hourglass to track the time. They were easily cast.",
    "The hours wore on. He'd observed something new by this time: after eleven (was it eleven?) hours, one's attention began to waver. Simple things like the snow-covered boughs of a faraway tree became impossible to look away from. A solitary snowflake would capture his attention as it fell through the air, slowly spiraling. More curiously, it would hold it even after the flake disappeared--instead of neatly shifting his focus to the next drifting object, the link would be broken. He would look at nothing at all. And after some time, he would stumble. He would fall in the snow, coating his cloak with dissolving white. He would grow colder still. He would come closer to death. Perhaps it wasn't too late: perhaps a large flame could dry him and chase the chill from his bones.<br>He trudged on.",
    "It was perhaps a long time before the man in the cloak realized something was different. He had fallen, like he had fallen many times before, but this time he had simply failed to get up. He was sinking into a snowdrift and had the distinct sensation of falling. He had the feeling that every moment brought him an inch deeper into the snow, and brought another inch of snow falling down on top of him. It was possible, he imagined, to pick himself up out of the snow, but every part of his body disagreed. It was all he could do to turn his head towards the sky, to peer at the indistinct shapes above him. To try and listen to the vague noises amidst the snow. Curious, he thought. That on death's doorstep, he would begin to hallucinate.<br>Black began to eat away at the edges of his vision. He could be saved yet, if he only brought himself somewhere safe. It was a difficult spell, to travel instantaneously. Only the most skilled magicians could do it, and only then with preparation. There were dangers, to be sure, but all of them paled before the specter of death around him. Could his frost-covered fingers make the motions? Could his chattering mouth form the words?<br>He would never know. He closed his eyes and the blackness overtook him. He was floating, perhaps for a very long time.",
    "It wasn't the sort of blackness that one expected to wake up from, but wake up he did. Slowly, and in fits, but eventually he did come to wakefulness. The man in the bed opened his eyes to see a roughly-worked wooden roof above his head, a warm fire crackling in the hearth. He drew air into his lungs and coughed, hacked, spasmed in the scratchy sheets. When he recovered he noticed the young boy sitting on the table watching him, head cocked. Blond hair a complete mess. \"You're new,\" he said, and the invalid nodded.<br>\"I just rolled in,\" he said, or tried to--there was a great deal of coughing. But once he understood, the boy shook his head.<br>\"Now you're new,\" the boy clarified. \"You need a new name.\"<br>\"Ah.\" There was a moment of contemplation before he waved one bandaged arm and said the first name that had popped into his head: \"Tom, I suppose.\"<br>\"Tom.\" The boy nodded. \"I'm Alec. You're a carpenter.\"<br>\"I am?\"<br>\"Well. You are now. We need one.\"<br>\"We?\"<br>\"Our village. You ask a lot of questions.\"<br>The man in the bed--Tom--nodded. <br>\"It's annoying,\" the boy complained, and hopped off the table. He walked straight for the door and was out it before Tom could ask anything more. The invalid was left to contemplate his new name and the new life that came with it. A carpenter? He'd never so much as hammered a nail. He knew a spell that could do the trick, as sure as he knew one that could drop this strange house around him. One that could set the wood around him on fire. A simple one that could twist his neck so far and so quick he'd never feel a thing. <br>\"Tom,\" he said out loud, like he was experimenting fitting his lips around it. \"Tom.\"<br>Perhaps even a monster like him could start over."

To them it was exactly like facing down an enemy nation that had planted its boots directly in their territory. Who had overcome every obstacle thrown their way. Who had even defeated the heavensent warriors prophesied to be able to topple him. In fact, it was worse: it was just one man.",
    "The princess sat huddled beside her bed, arms wrapped around her knees. Her beautiful golden hair was messy and unkempt, her cheeks stained with dried tears. She bit her lip and squeezed her eyes shut, trying to block out the awful noises that came from outside... and after a moment, it worked. Her royal bedroom was filled with silence. Princess Eilonwy dared to open her eyes--just when her doors swung open. She let out a yelp and cringed back into the side of her bed, wishing she could just disappear. She heard him walking close, and then she felt his touch on her shoulder. Although she'd been expecting claws or perhaps fur, his touch felt human-like. It even felt a little warm. And then vertigo descended on her: her mind spun, her head throbbed and she was no longer at all sure if she was moving or motionless. Her eyes snapped open and Eilonwy stumbled backwards, rising and slapping his hand away. \"Monster!\" she cried! \"I won't let you... oh.\"<br>Eilonwy blinked her eyes, her vision adjusting to what was suddenly and undeniably not her quarters. Every sense of comfort and kindness had been stripped away: her large, comfortable bed had been replaced by a cot with a moth-eaten blanket. The lush carpets she'd loved to wriggle her toes in had been obliterated completely, and her bare feet now cringed at the feel of the roughly-worked stone floor. There were no paintings of knights and chivalry and unicorns--instead, the only thing that could be said to be decoration were the spiderwebs in the corners. And instead of her beautiful bay windows that overlooked the tournament grounds... now she was treated to a misshapen square cut out of the living rock and beyond it, a drop to crashing waters that surely her fallen body would be utterly consumed by. She was so shocked by the dismal place she'd been brought to that she almost missed the rat poking its head from a crack where the floor met the wall. Underneath their feet a magical circle, glowing with power, faded and disappeared.",
    "Eilonwy turned, trembling but determined to be strong. The man who'd captured her--a man, not a monster, at least in appearance--had taken off the garish mask with the smiling face he'd worn. Behind it was a surprisingly normal visage of a man who seemed hardly old enough to grow hair on his chin. Although his features were sharp, his expression wasn't unkind: his brown eyes seemed pleasant and the look he gave her almost seemed apologetic. Not that she would fall for his tricks.<br>\"Where have you taken me?\" she demanded with a trembling voice. \"is this to be my prison?\" She swept her hand out at the utterly Spartan conditions. \"Do you intend to get your revenge against my kingdom by subjecting me to this cruelty?\"",
    "The Demon Lord looked at her with a quizzical expression. \"Here? No, I have a room for you nearby you'll be staying in. I did some research on what would be appropriate.\"",
    "\"Oh.\" The princess paused, her steam lost. \"Why did you bring me to the dungeon first, then?\" She glared at him. \"To frighten me?\" She puffed out her chest, not feeling very brave at all. \"Because it won't work.\"",
    "\"What?\" He paused. \"No, I wasn't thinking anything like that. It was just convenient--I have a magic circle in my room, so bringing you here was easiest.\"",
    "\"You...\" she paused, trying to come to terms with what she'd just heard. \"This is your room?\"",
    "\"It is.\"",
    "\"You live like this?\"",
    "\"Yes?\"",
    "He looked at her with a quizzical expression and she began to realize he simply didn't understand. That he thought, somehow, this was normal. \"Come on,\" he beckoned. \"I'll show you to your room.\"",
    "Eilonwy paused for a moment, then walked unsteadily after him. He was a very different type of person than he'd expected."

Once in the gap of a temple’s hidden room he had held a pair of bone-white manacles in his hands and felt at once that they had contracted fully around his wrists. He had dreamed that thrice since and each nightmare had ended in sweat and fevered terror. Once they held him they would not let go.<br>Now he simply did as he was told. It was a comfortable kind of surrender, and it gave him an opportunity to rise higher than he’d ever imagined.",
		"The great serpent, still spasming slightly, was clear evidence of that. He was a dangerous man in a dark alley, but the snake had somehow known they were coming, had rushed at them with eyes gleaming, and his own knife was small compared to a single one of its fangs. And yet it was his weapon that dripped with wine-rich blood.<br>His companion held the true credit for the kill: a fortune-teller, she had introduced herself, and she had said many things about him that she couldn’t have known. All of this, Cat Caro had said, she’d seen in a dream. She’d smiled when she’d said it and the mercenary had imagined it was a joke, but before he’d pulled a board from the window to reach and unlock the door she had told him to wield his knife in his left hand. And now the snake was dead. And the man with the knife, who had for the first time wielded a knife in his left hand, was not.",
		"\"How did you know?\" he asked her quietly, his voice gravel-and-glass. He was not a handsome man and his voice betrayed his nature as surely as the graceful way he flicked the blood from his blade. Cat Caro turned, her earrings jingling, and simply smiled at him. He nodded and pursed his thin lips. After a moment he went to the door and checked the windows. The street was still dark. The night was still long. The city slept like the dead and when the thrashing of the snake ceased fully still no constables had appeared. The mercenary breathed out once, clipped, and relaxed only a little. He watched the woman work.",
		"Cat Caro had bent in her Oriental dress and was flicking through a bookcase on the wall, slender fingers nudging books aside like a butcher’s knife slicing along the grain. The dust didn’t seem to bother her, nor the fresh cobwebs. She was a slim, slender thing, seeming totally unsuited for this kind of dirty work, and if he had been a different man he might have said so. But if he had come to this house alone, he would have surely perished. It was no small thing to stand between a man and his death. He knew that intimately. His mouth opened as he prepared to speak, but it was as if the fortune-teller had anticipated the question. Without turning, without raising her head from the pages she was now plucking through, she answered him. \"I saw it in a dream,\" she said once more, and a laugh was embedded in her voice like a jewel in a broach. \"We came to a house like this, found a snake like this one, and now…\"<br>\"Now?\"<br>\"And then we found a door just like the one we will.\"<br>He considered the idea of a hidden passageway and tried to remember what the house had looked like from the outside. It was all twists and kitty-corners and mismatched architecture, and if there was more to the inside he couldn’t imagine--<br>\"Perhaps the space beyond will offer us a fireplace or a furnace to match the chimney,\" she offered, and he turned aside from the shame of missing such an obvious omission in the rooms they had found so far.",
		"Perhaps Cat Caro understood his embarrassment, for she continued speaking. \"A woman lived here, and she put together a collection. It’s my leader’s understanding that some interesting volumes may be included in it.\"<br>\"Did you dream that too?\" he asked, voice gruff.<br>\"Of course I did,\" she answered as if it was perfectly obvious. As if it was perfectly ordinary to dream of a whole day before living it.<br>\"And?\"<br>\"And I believe him.\" The fortune-teller didn’t elaborate further.",
		"The mercenary didn’t have any reason to argue that point. He had been employed for several expeditions like this one, and although he had never met the man anyone who commanded the kind of knowledge and the sorts of companions he did had to be formidable himself. It was a personal point of pride that among the many mercenaries available, it was his knife the leader had hired. With every successful mission his dreams of fortune and glory seemed to grow a little closer, like they were gradually more tangible.",
		"Still the woman pressed her fingers against the wall and cocked her head, as if she was looking through the wood. She stepped by a painting, some dusty portrait on the wall of a woman the mercenary didn’t recognize, and she stopped to stare at it. Then she moved on. He watched her go and slid his eyes back along the wall to the portrait. \"If you dreamt all this,\" he said slowly, \"Does that mean you dreamt where the door was?\"<br>\"Perhaps.\"<br>\"And? Can’t you think back on the dream and just… remember where the door was?\"<br>\"I could,\" she admitted, and he turned to stare at her. She met his gaze evenly and her eyes seemed to peer into the back of his head. It made his spine want to crawl right out of his body, this sensation that she knew everything he had ever thought. And yet he felt he was unable to look away. It was as if two metal bars connected their eyes together. Only when she looked away was he freed of the sensation. And at last, she said:",
		"\"Don’t you think surprises are wonderful?\"",
		"He waited for more, but an explanation never came. Instead she continued her investigation. The mercenary didn’t think surprises were so wonderful–after all, a surprise here almost meant being speared by serpent’s fangs–but his voice was gone. His throat was rough and scratched; he rarely spoke so frequently or for so long. It was something about this woman that made him speak at all.<br>He turned back to the painting and noticed, for the first time, it was slightly crooked. The house had been ransacked and the floorboards soiled, but the painting was merely nudged. It didn’t seem right, and after a moment he reached out, hesitantly, to adjust it. There was a resistance to the adjustment and when it was righted, a click. A small portion of the wall next to it, barely large enough for a man to fit in, creaked partway open to reveal a cramped set of stairs.",
		"The mercenary grinned and turned to tell his companion, but of course she had already seen. She congratulated him with a smile and a nod and as they climbed the stairs together her knowing, crystal laughter filled the stairway and the hidden room beyond."

    "And in my dreams, when I remove my fingers the smile remains.",
    "A doll is not supposed to dream; this is common knowledge and I never found any reason to doubt it until I met Hei. The first dream I ever experienced was of him taking my hand in his, and I will never forget it as long as I live. Ever since that moment he has made me… confused. He is confusing.<br/>",
    "Sometimes I think I will never understand.",
    "But here in my dreams, I can pretend I know all. In my dreams I raise my face to him and somehow I can see his expression without aid, and somehow I perceive that he answers my smile.",
    "Sometimes there is more, and this too is confusing. I have felt his lips on mine and I recall that it was pleasant.<br/>",
    "It is not an easy thing for me to talk freely and I’d be glad of never having to say another word as long as I live. Words are flimsy and fake; people lie as easily as they smile and I hate nothing more than a lie. That is why the melody of a piano is so soothing to my heart–music can never tell a lie or try to fool you. And in my dreams I speak to Hei without words, I say everything that could be said and he replies in kind.",
    "Hei has never lied to me.",
    "It is an anguish to wake, though feeling his presence beside me tempers the pain. He notices my eyes open and he says my name, the one he chose for me: Yin. It is a sweet agony to hear that word, all the more hurtful because I cannot answer it the way I do in my dreams. I think as hard as I can, trying to convey all I feel, but it does not reach him. I open my mouth to echo the confession but cannot find the words. No phrases or empty sayings could adequately explain how I feel and words lie too easily. He might not believe me or worse, might not feel the same.<br/>",
    "A single word comes out instead: “Hei.” I put all the emotion I can into it but my voice just sounds artificial, inhuman. Like a Doll’s.<br/>",
    "He turns back to his work and I adjust his shirt on my frame, worrying needlessly over whether some part of me had been exposed. I say I worry when in fact I am not sure if I want to leave this top button open or closed; perhaps I am most afraid he would look away if I did so. Politeness can sting as much as hatred at times.",
    "I am not sorry to be what is called a “Doll.” it allows me certain talents that are useful to me. It makes my outside just as plain as my inside. It gives me the power to help Hei. Sometimes I wonder if I would still be playing a quiet concerto in an empty building if I had not become like this. Sometimes I wonder if Hei would still allow me to follow him if I was not a Doll. It is painful to wonder, too.",
    "I cannot see Hei without water, but I know what he feels like. I know his hands that dwarf mine, catching my tiny fingers in his grasp. I know the curve of his arm and the hardness of his chest. I know the structure of his face, and I know the subtle tones that indicate his mood. I know when he is angry and I know when he is sad. I know that he is strange, just like me.<br/>",
    "And I know the feeling of his presence, the safeness that washes over me like a warm ripple. Being near him is like a hot tub and a crystal lake all at once. He startles me awake when he comes near but as he does I start to lose the feeling in my head and I become fuzzy. I want to lay back and think of nothing at all; if it were not for a desire to protect him then I would certainly spend my time keeping perfectly still and perfectly quiet so I can hear and feel every sound he makes, even if it is just the deep evenness of his breathing or the solid beat of his heart.",
    "Is it strange for a Doll to have feelings?",
    "Both Contractors and Dolls are supposed to act completely rationally. Besides our powers, this is what differentiates us from humans. And yet in my time with Hei I have seen the emotionless act very oddly. I remember well the smile that new Doll gave me. From a sink in the corner I watched her eyes light up when I mentioned the boy trying to save her. It made me feel strange, “watching” that couple so devoted to each other. It was a good feeling but bad too, and I do not understand it.<br/>",
    "There have been others that defy common sense. If no Contractor makes an irrational move then why did that woman throw herself in front of an automobile to save Huang? When he told me the story all I could think was how strange it was. Now I wonder if I wouldn’t do the same.",
    "It is pleasant to be in this place with Hei. It is the first time since Tokyo that we have been alone, and the sound of the sea is wonderful. When we walk along the beach I ache to have his hand in mine but I haven’t the courage to reach out. Perhaps next time, I tell myself, but I can never bring myself to do so. It is lonely sleeping in a small, cold bed but it is enough to have him in the same room. I have never felt so safe as when he sits beside my bed and stares into the night. I should like to have him lay beside me, but I should count my blessings. Just this much is fine for now; just this much is pleasant.",
    "And when he sleeps I repay the kindness, though I doubt my watch is as complete or as reassuring as his is to me. When the night is quiet I watch him through my Spectre and I dream while waking of nothing in particular; perhaps, his hands or his arms or the warmth of his skin. It is hard to return my attention to the hotel but a little lapse means nothing. This place is safe. We are safe together. I snatch little moments from the night like raindrops on my hand. This night I tiptoed to his side and tried to speak my heart, but failed. I wanted to say everything I felt but all that came were two short, stunted words:",
    "“I love…”",
    "I hate words. They’re slippery and false. They play both listener and speaker for fools. If only I could be honest with my actions: just once I have leaned in and brushed his lips with mine. Just once I have felt raw electricity race through my body. I wanted to kiss him fully, wake him up or touch his skin, but I am afraid.",
    "Instead, I dream of his smile. I like to think that I would know he was smiling even if I could not see it, though I know such a thing to be ridiculous. But that is what my dreams are for: hoping for something ephemeral, like clutching at a spider’s thread.",
    "I dream of him feeling the same way I do.",
    "I dare to hope that one day it will be so, but for now I will simply keep watch. Just a Doll, saying and feeling nothing. He doesn’t have to know that just feeling him near changes me in ways I cannot understand.<br/>",
    "For now, it’s enough.",

		"There was a secret to the path a knife followed: just as a traveler followed the best-worn paths on a jaunt over the Continent, so a knife took the path of least resistance. This was the first lesson Rose had learnt in her youth, and as she'd grown into a slim whip of a woman she'd never once had room to doubt it. In her skilled hands, the cut seemed like it was through butter. Soft, easy. Even the drunk seemed surprised by the way his gut was opened--even the writhing ropes of intestines within him, like snakes sheltering the winter, only peeked free in questing curiosity. Rose held the man in her arms as the autumn's cold crept into him, as he slowly came to terms with the position he'd been placed into. He struggled slowly, briefly, rasping out in a terrified gasp. And she breathed deep. The scent of his foul breath and the cheap gin he'd drunk suffused her, became part of her, and filled her behind each soft eyelid. Her partner in the dance leaned on her more and more as his own strength faltered, until he had slumped to the ground in a vaguely human-shaped pile. At last Rose opened her eyes and blew out the breath she'd been holding. The thrill lasted in her veins for a ten-count, maybe two... but it was soon gone. And Rose was simply Rose.",
		"The woman standing there in the darkness of the alley seemed to realize her knife still dripped blood and examined the tool curiously. The knife was a thick and ugly piece of metal, badly-worked wood clamped on steel that fit unnaturally to the hand. But it was hers and she held it like a lover, admiring the slow ruby droplets as they fell to the dirty ground. When the blood had begun to slow, the material to gum, she crouched and wiped the blade against the corpse's coat. Something caught her eye: a slip of paper tucked into his frayed pocket.<br>Normally, Rose took nothing but memories from her victims. But perhaps she remembered her other half then, or perhaps some stranger force urged her to do it. After a moment of hesitation the paper was hers. After all, he had no need of it any longer.",
		"In calm, confident script, the hand of a scribe--perhaps, an artist--had written the following:<br>Each scar is an opportunity. Each a gift. A splintered sword still works its way to the heart.<br>Come with me, and be made whole.<br>-N.S.",
		"Rose didn't know why, but her hand strayed. It brushed her hip and traced along the long, thin scar concealed beneath her dress. It was hot, enflamed, throbbing. She could feel her heartbeat through it, and snatched away her hand with the urgency of a child who's touched a kettle. And like she had the kettle, long ago, Rose gently touched the scar again",
		"The note led to a whisper, to another, and to another--Rose would have been frustrated by the long string of almost-connections, but each stop before the conclusion seemed to bring her a little closer, another step towards the progenitor of the mysterious message. The \"N.S.\" it was signed by. Every time she spoke with another along the chain they seemed more urgent. They seemed more possessed of a strange energy, a finality, a violence. Sometimes they shared their secrets with Rose willingly, but as she drew closer these chance meetings became more violent. She found herself asking questions with the tip of her dagger, and then at its hilt. The pieces and fragment-forms she heard spurred her on, and before she was aware of it Rose had come to spend her whole day searching. How did one find a single voice within the ugly, sprawling city? How did one find a single sentence among a library? A drop of blood within the veins?",
		"In the end it was by accident she found her quarry. When the trail had cooled her feet had led her on, stepping lightly towards a club of ill-repute. Rose didn't realize her destination until her steps had stopped in view of the pink-and-red curtains, the exact color of flesh beneath skin. There the matron stood, bright eyes gleaming in the gas lamplight. It was strange: although Rose had come here many, many times... before. She had never once seen the woman blink.<br>Rose was intimately familiar with the scene in front of her: the furtive, nervous, almost regretful crowd filtering from the club's entrance. Perhaps it was because of this she instantly picked out the single, different element: instead of the vaguely Greek mountain of a man the matron usually spoke with, now she was engaged in conversation with a stylishly-dressed woman, all curves and deadly angles. What the conversation was, Rose couldn't be certain of... or if it ended favorably. But when the two parted, she saw enough of the strange woman to recognize the description she'd been given by her last \"contact.\" The woman turned to a nearby alley and entered it with purpose: Rose followed.",
		"Rose learned many things about the woman she followed in the next several minutes. She saw her prey step gracefully along raised cobblestones, keeping her shoes free of the clinging muck. Only once did she deviate from a perfectly straight path: a screeching rat defended its scrap of garbage from the intruder and in a movement so harsh and sharp it had to be admired, the woman's heel slammed down with a furious crunch. Momentarily she paused to clean her shoe.<br>Rose struck. Or perhaps, would have struck. But she was brought up short by a voice, razor-sharp, like a pen-knife held to her delicate throat. \"What do you plan on doing with that ugly thing?\" She asked, and turned to fix Rose with her stare. Instantly Rose disliked her: the woman's body was voluptuous, her stare sharp, her posture relaxed. Her hands free by her sides, empty. No less capable for it. Rose hated her smile the most: it was an ugly, sharp expression, thin and red like a knife wound across her face. It reminded Rose of the way her father had looked, once.<br>\"You're looking for me,\" the woman continued without interruption. \"You want to hear what I have to say. You think I might have the answer to a question you're afraid to ask.\" Rose wanted to spit at her. She clutched her knife like it was a trembling neck and gritted her teeth. It didn't stop the flow of words, sibilant and sharp. \"If you want to hear these words, you will kneel. And you will serve.\" Rose could have laughed, if she had the breath. If the woman's words weren't wrapping around her, cinching her, squeezing tight her lungs. \"But first,\" the woman sighed, \"a test. How sharp is the stick in your hand?\"",
		"Rose snorted. She found the strength to speak: squeezing her knife like a lifeline she pointed it directly at the strange woman. \"Sharp enough,\" she said, and hated herself for the trembling in her voice. It didn't have the effect she wanted or expected (needed); instead, the woman simply smiled a wicked slash. \"We will see,\" she said, and carelessly stripped from her elegant dress a string of fabric. She held it above the knife and let it drift down. As Rose's eyes were fixed to the strand, the woman grabbed her wrist in an iron grip and turned the knife upwards, sharply, wrenching her half over. And they watched. They watched the string float down, down, down... the middle touched the weapon's deadly edge and it bent, draped itself like a lover over a couch. There was another moment of hope, then, when the trailing legs folded neatly down. But even their weight did not part the strand.",
		"Rose collapsed, her knees knocking into the cobbles amid the muck. She trembled, possessed of a great and terrible sorrow. A mountain-shaped bitterness. A tranquil undertow of rage. It all met at the juncture of the woman's fingers, strong like iron rods, and it all drained out of Rose's veins when the woman dropped her grip. Rose's hand fell lifelessly to the ground and the knife went clattering, discarded and useless. She would have to apologize to him later.<br>\"Well,\" the woman announced, her sharp voice rimed with disappointment. \"Not so sharp, yet. But it will be.\" She towered over the kneeling woman and spoke the words left unsaid in her letter. In her messages. In her doctrine.<br>And when it was done, Rose could only call her \"Mentor.\""

		"Rose later learned that she was the very first of her Mentor's recruits. More came, and soon: first one by one, then in small packages bundled by a common thread. They stole in like ghosts in the night, pale sheets with questing eyes. Rose never saw a single one fail to appear after their initiation--not even the numerous hangers-on, indistinguishable bookkeeping types with dainty hands and empty faces. Perhaps they came to believe the words that were said. Perhaps they feared what would happen to them if they left. There were, after all, a great number of knives involved in every ritual. It didn't take any great intelligence to imagine their use on traitors.",
		"The meetings themselves were not nightly; in fact, as far as Rose could tell, there was no true pattern to them. At times they met at night, at others during the bright bloom of day--only the location remained a constant. A quaint enough place, Rose had hardly been able to believe her eyes when she had been called there the first time: an otherwise unremarkable bar, curtains pulled, the name on the signboard so old and faded it was indecipherable. The large booth her Mentor sat in wasn't even shuttered--but in all the times they met there, Rose never saw a barkeep. And at any rate, their leader didn't seem bothered by the potential danger... so her followers put it out of their minds. They sat, and they sipped tea or something harder from the back of the bar, and they listened.<br>And they grew.",
		"She received her first assignment one month after her induction, exactly. Their Mentor had spoken a story that night that Rose did not yet understand, and she was not alone: several of them lingered, nursed their drinks, thought. The man called \"Pope\" spoke first, as usual, and spoke loudly.<br>\"The two she spoke of are us,\" he bellowed, \"herself the scarred man and us the goddamn traitors!\" The large, gruff man slammed his glass stein on the table and deepened the cracks in its base. He had drunk five like it already. Already the woman to his side was shaking her head, although she hadn't ceased for a single moment to smile. It lit up the booth they sat at. \"I think the world is the figure with scars, and us the traitors,\" she chirped. \"Don't you think being traitors would be exciting?\" She giggled and the table found laughing along almost irresistible. Even Rose smiled, her eyes flicking over the assembled group. She knew all their names, although she couldn't quite recall when she'd heard some of them: \"Pope\", or Clifton, who'd spoken first. Clovette, second. Neville, now, pausing like he had to get his thoughts in neat little rows before presenting them. \"I think...\" he swallowed, eyes drifting nervously. \"Maybe it is just a metaphor. Allies inevitably come to blows... or something of that nature.\" Auclair, beside him, said nothing. As always.",
		"They talked for a short time thereafter, but no further ground was gained. Many nights went like this, tumbling down the twisting labyrinth of the secret world their Mentor was ever so slowly opening to them; often, promising ideas led them to brick walls. Often, new understandings meant retracing their steps only to discover the landscape of this new, secret world had changed. It all required a different kind of intelligence than Rose possessed, she found, and was often frustrated when answers failed to materialize immediately--which they rarely did. It was nothing at all like the simplicity of a murder or a cunning plan, which she was beginning to understand were not so different at all. Rose lingered in the bar as the bell above the door rang, signalling the last of her compatriots' departure. For a moment she didn't move. She just stood at the end of the table and held the stem of her wineglass in her hand.  She rubbed her thumb against the smudged glass and swirled the ruby wine. Again the bell rang, and she snatched her hand away from the wingelass, leaving it to wobble, then right itself. Rose clenched her fist and looked at the visitor: the Mentor herself, smiling enigmatically and watching the settling wine in the glass. If she saw a significance to it, she didn't voice her discovery.",
		"\"Rose\", she spoke sharply. There was no other tone she possessed. \"I thought I might find you here.\" And a smile split her face: an ugly expression that filled Rose with a deep discomfort. The killer inclined her own head: \"Mentor\", she said, unable to deny the power--and the knowledge--that the woman called \"N.S.\" possessed. \"That's alright,\" the woman allowed, but it was clear to Rose just how much she enjoyed the reverence. \"Take a seat. There's something I'd like to ask of you.\" Not even a trace of a request could be found within her voice, but that was to be expected. The power dynamic was clear and well-established: even without the power of knowledge the woman possessed, Rose had seen first-hand just how lethally quick and strong her Mentor was. Rose's allegiance was given grudgingly but completely. There existed killers who trifled with matters beyond their strength, but the lives they lived were short and sharp as the arts they practiced. So Rose sat, and Rose waited as her Mentor poured a tumbler of scotch, and Rose listened. And this is what her Mentor said:",
		"\"There are those who don't wish to see us continue this work--did you know that?\" A sharp smile. \"An organization, or many organizations conjoined, full of turned-downward faces who hear the words spoken in shadow and shut their ears fast.\" The delicate, careless way she held her glass was a laughable distraction from the acts Rose had seen her steely hands commit. \"There's a man on the case, hardly a problem for us at the moment. But the more he learns, the more others do as well, more capable sorts.\" A moment of silence fell, but it was a silence empty of air for her disciple. To speak would have been to choke. \"Taking care of him would be a simple task,\" she offered. \"Even for a dull knife like yours.\" Rose's eyes flashed and her hand strayed, but not too far. She had sharpened her blade diligently, daily, excessively. She had never had the courage to test it against a falling thread, as her Mentor had. \"You will kill him, or you will be killed,\" she said, as easily as if she were describing the outcomes of a children's game. And with the transmission of a slip of paper bearing an address, that was that.",
		"Rose stood, understanding the conversation had finished. But her Mentor's voice brought her up short: \"rude, isn't it, to refuse a toast?\" The ice in the smiling woman's glass clinked gently as she held it up. Rose took her own glass, but hesitated. The whirling red pool beckoned: just a taste, a sip, a drink. A muted ache. She met the Mentor's eyes and lifted the glass to her lips, drinking deeply. The red liquid slipped down her throat and was lost but for a dull glow in her stomach. The ugly, red-slash smile followed her out of the bar and into the streets. Her own tightly-coiled fury was almost enough to block out the rising ache in her chest.",
		"She learned a great deal in the next few days, about the shadowy organization known as the Suppression Bureau as well as the man assigned to her Mentor's particular case. Rose didn't need much: his name was Douglas, he had worked the force for several decades, and was by all accounts a no-nonsense fellow who liked his cases closed quickly, neatly, satisfactorily. What was more surprising was that he wasn't really part of the Suppression Bureau at all: although at first Rose toyed with the idea he might be undercover, further investigation persuaded her otherwise. That was enough for her to be satisfied: although some killers preferred extensive research on their targets, Rose was more impatient. Truly, all she'd needed was the address of his average downtown flat--and that she had been given. She was ready.",
		"The day before the deed, Rose was abuzz. Her investigation had taken her through the city, but had not allowed for her to slake the desire that built up in her stomach like a compressed spring. She found herself stroking the hilt of her ugly, malformed knife, squeezing the handle, imagining leading every man or woman she walked by down a nearby alley. Opening them up. Relishing in the thrill, however temporary it would be. She controlled these impulses, but they led her inexorably to a small street choked with shops. A thousand different smells and sights, a thousand yells and hawkers and more. Here, a bookstore choked with ancient manuscripts. There, a storefront gleaming with gold and silver trinkets, brass gewgaws and strange iron implements from across the Continent. And in front of her, a flower shop with bouquets sprouting from plain vases, multicolored fountains like peacock's tails. Roses of every color but yellow. There a wiry man with a well-kept mustache slid a knife expertly through a tulip's stem at a perfect 45-degree angle. Another knife produced, he began to snip off the leaves.<br>She turned on her heel and walked away, not knowing where or what direction, the ache in her chest throbbing with her beating heart.",
		"Douglas was a simple, ordinary man with an above-average moral compass, or so he would--and did, often--describe himself. He liked to have everything just so, and his home reflected that: walls bare except for maps of the City, papers on his desk in neatly-stacked piles. When he arrived home each day he would pick a corner of his small flat and clean it top to bottom. This was the way to eradicate crime, he was fond of saying: by taking on small, manageable tasks and carrying them out to the utmost of one's ability. Improving discrete items. Fixing minor problems. The areas he'd made his mark in were indicated on his maps and looking at them gave Douglas a fierce sense of pride. He looked at them often. He only tore his eyes away when the knock on his door sounded out a second time. Grumbling, sure it was another last-minute assignment, Douglas pushed his moustache back with two fingers and opened the door a few inches. He took a step back, surprised, as a woman fell in: breathing shallowly, slender dress askew, forehead hot. He caught her with both hands, careful where he touched, and brought her gently to the floor. \"Miss?\" he asked gruffly. \"Are you quite alright?\" She murmured something indistinct. Douglas was a veteran: he mentally walked through the steps of the battlefield medicine he knew.<br>Her chest rose and fell slightly with each breath.<br>Her skin was flushed and her forehead damp with sweat.<br>Her pulse was slow and purposeful.<br>Douglas felt a slow, unnatural fear steal over him. His eyes flashed to her face and he found hers already open: cool and calm, triumphant. A knife of shoddy make but undeniable deadliness was at his throat and he couldn't even swallow. \"Please\", the woman spoke to him. Softly, like a lover. \"I'd like to know all about your investigation, inspector.\" If she was expecting instant compliance, she would be disappointed. He had been through the war: he was no coward.",
		"The woman called Rose learned a great deal from Douglas that night, even of things perhaps her Mentor would have preferred remained mysterious. The learning was long, and painful for Douglas, but she gave him the ending he eventually begged for.<br>Later, the body once called Douglas told even more to the fellow from the Suppression Bureau who inspected him. And Spencer came to know a great deal about the woman called Rose."

		"Their Mentor had told them many things, many secrets which had guided their feet as well as their hands. There had been a boat, and there had been a series of trains. Rose had been outside the City, once: she held it among her fondest memories. Her father, her brother and she had summered in a small place on the water, and she had dreamed those humid days might become her reality. But soon the little home had become crowded full with the splintered wood of her father's temper, the clipped calmness of her brother, her own subtle rage. The embarrassed silences that were the secret growing between his children. Had they been older, then, it might have come to blows. But then it had just become a powderkeg they abandoned before it blew.",
		"Rose was not alone in her travel: with her was a slim briefcase containing an abominable amount of money in several different forms. It was, perhaps, enough for an enterprising individual to disappear with, although that idea had no allure for Rose. She didn't know exactly where she belonged but it was at least below the skyline of the City and now, it was at the feet of her Mentor. She knew very little for certain but she knew that. Every secret was a loose thread tightened, every small task performed was a knot pulled tight. In the process of a single season Rose had become bound to the strange woman with the knife-slash smile. Even in her dreams she was a looming figure.",
		"A slender hand stretched: the suitcase came to rest on the seat across from her. It was like Clovette, Rose's other companion on this little journey, had heard her thoughts and chosen to move first: this was the conclusion Rose might have come to if the woman hadn't been smiling just as cheerily as always. \"What a lark,\" her companion exclaimed, gazing with wonder out the window as the train clattered along. \"Have you ever seen something so fine?\"<br>For a moment, Rose entertained the idea that Clovette had found something truly interesting to stare at, but no: the hills were the same as always, the small towns as flavorless, the odd smattering of sheep as uninspiring. Rose suppressed a sigh and occupied herself with the long scar on her hip and the knife she carried under her dress: tracing fingers along both as if testing whether their essential shape had changed. Clovette didn't seem to mind Rose's inattention. The cheerful woman took a long, luxuriating sip from her wine glass, and Rose's eyes flicked to its twin in front of her. Rose wasn't sure she liked the woman sitting across from each other, which was a departure from the general dislike she held for her Mentor's other students. Clovette seemed harmless enough with her sun-bright smile but there was always the sense she was pushing, ever so slightly, like a child eroding the sand beneath a beach-ledge, curious just when gravity would take notice and the ledge would topple. It was an innocuous act, buying a glass of wine for a companion, unbidden. But it was hardly the first subtle nudge and it proved to be far from the last over their journey. When they disembarked Rose was glad for it: the woman's optimism, if nothing else, was exhausting.",
		"They knew the place before they saw it, and not because of the laughably little information they'd been provided about it; instead, the <em>feel</em> of the grand mansion gave its occult nature away, as well as its isolation. What nearby farmsteads existed were rotting, half-dead, leaning over as if themselves trying to escape the final resting place of Filip Forman. The mansion itself seemed to be in greater repair, but not by much. Broken windows leered out at the overgrown dirt road that snaked to its front.<br>\"What a perfectly dreary place!\" Clovette laughed and Rose found it was a strain not to match her mirth, not to at least smile. She did her best. \"You'd think a fellow would want to do research out in the sunlight,\" Clovette chattered on. \"Especially on worms. Worms! Curiouser and curiouser.\" She tried the door and exclaimed, \"Open! Well, isn't that a lucky coincidence? In we go!\" And in, as she said, Clovette went. Rose followed but not without a deep frown: that this large mansion would be unlocked and unguarded gave her an even worse feeling than the suspicion she'd been harboring already. She didn't fear violence, but some of the elements their Mentor had lectured about didn't seem like they could be fought. Not with a knife, anyway.<br>Rose figured she would find out. Only for a moment, as she entered the decaying mansion, did she wish she'd drunk that glass of wine.",
		"Stepping on the discarded bones of the house's great, expansive windows turned out to be impossible to avoid. Loud crunching, crystalline teeth crumbled underfoot and made Rose's muscles tense. Clovette strode along, humming, unconcerned. She peeked into this room and that, never seeming quite satisfied with the contents. Rose slipped from wall to wall herself, making as little noise as she possibly could, misshapen knife already in her hand. She swept each room more cautiously than Clovette, noting the expensive laboratory equipment and the many, many specimens encased in amber, glass, and formaldehyde. <em>Nematomorpha</em>, a jar of what looked like knotted string was labeled, and under it \"Gordiacea.\" A cricket suspended in liquid, normal until one noticed the slender tube spiraling through its body: <em>Paragordius tricuspidatus.</em> And everywhere, <em>Vermes.</em> Rose, in her morbid fascination, had almost lost her sense of danger until Clovette stopped short. The cheery woman's smile had faltered, her lips quirking in a confused expression. Rose slipped silently to the doorway at which she stood, and looked inside: her turn to grin, ferally. \"Now there's a sight,\" she whispered, and stepped into the room. Behind her Clovette murmured something that confused the trained killer: \"He's stopped...\"",
		"Stopped or not, he was the perfect prey. The man stood at a table, looking down at a shattered glass cage, oblivious. The back of his neck exposed, his shoulders relaxed, his clothes draped over his emaciated frame, themselves badly ragged. Almost, decaying. She put his fashion out of her mind and stepped close, furious joy sparking in her veins as she once again did what she had been born to. The ugly edge of her knife caressed the man's neck, ripped it in a hard line across, came back and slid up, through, into, twist--a gentle stirring of the brain. She made to catch him as he would doubtlessly crumble, to hold him tight as the life ebbed away, to share one last dance. But just then--<br>\"ROSE!\"<br>The thing turned, its head rotating further than a normal man's might. Creaks and cracking noises came from its frail body and with it, a terrible stench that made Rose gag. The eyes in its skull had long ago melted away, or been pecked out by crows, or consumed by something stranger: transfixed by the dead stare, she almost missed the arcing swing, sharp-tipped claws. The fingerbones might as well have been tipped in iron at how they tore through her dress, her shirt, the skin of her stomach. Rose tumbled backwards and swore as she knocked into the cold laboratory floor. A thin curtain of red slipped down her front, but wouldn't impede her. The corpse was on her in seconds, scrabbling, mumbling with its mummified mouth indistinct words that made Rose shudder.",
		"She didn't quite know how she kept out of its clutches in the ensuing moments: for the years the thing had undoubtedly spent rotting, it was fast as the wind. She sustained small slashes here and there, tearing ribbons through her dark dress, and would have suffered far more if Clovette hadn't jumped into the fray. Shouting petulantly at the creature, the cheerful woman pitched books and furniture, whatever was at hand. Dust rattled from the dead thing as it was pelted, head knocking from side to side with the impacts. Still, it never abandoned its clawing pursuit--and it scored a staggering hit at last. The dagger-like claws descended, catching Rose as she scrambled, digging into her right hip. They were flensing her alive, they were scratching at her soul! Rose screamed in a mixture of rage and agony, coiled her leg and kicked it backwards. The thing's head snapped, lolling lazily on its neck, but still it came. It met Rose's foot, again: it met her knife. She was on it like a lion, knife descending again and again and again. Rose mauled the grotesque thing, each puncture wound relinquishing a little sigh of dead dust. When Rose stood the corpse had come apart in a way that reminded her of old wooden dolls. The strings inside had been severed and the limbs were slipping free. The life, what there was of it, had left. Rose checked herself over and found that, to her surprise, the savage gash she'd sustained had hardly made an impact at all. The claw marks started and ended in the soft flesh of her thigh, but they'd avoided entirely the long, thin scar already present. For a moment, before she quashed the thought, a fierce sense of relief suffused her. Then she was merely glad she could still move, albeit stiffly.",
		"Clovette's enthusiasm was wholly untarnished by the experience, which if anything had made her twice as talkative. \"No shock the poor fellow died in here: it's <em>very</em> dull. Can you imagine filling your home with mummies? Mummies without bandages. How peculiar.\" She giggled once, and then stopped. Suddenly serious, the cheerful woman beckoned for Rose to approach. She pointed, nodding her head, and Rose followed her to see the Solar, glass ceiling half-collapsed, glass teeth bared and mouth howling. Some standing, some supine, there waited the sharp-fingered mumble-mouthed dead. \"I can feel them,\" Clovette whispered. \"They've stopped...\" she hesitated, clearing sruggling for the right word to use. \"Stopped going,\" she finally concluded, and seemed satisfied by the statement. \"Fine enough,\" Rose hissed. \"But how are we meant to take them on?\" The answer came from behind, in a voice cool as ice and just as shocking to the senses. A voice she knew better than the back of her father's hand.",
		"\"With my assistance, I suppose.\" ",
		"Rose spun, her knife already in her hand. Clovette watched with eager curiosity. And her brother simply raised an eyebrow.<br>After a long moment, she straightened. After a longer one, she slipped the knife away. If he'd recognized the ugly little implement, he didn't indicate it.<br>\"Victor,\" she said, one complete thought. \"Rose,\" he nodded calmly. \"It seems we're alike even in our devotion.\" He slipped on a thin smirk, then took it off and tossed it aside. \"I'd been wondering when our assignments would intersect.\" A spike of white-hot fury drove itself through Rose's spine. It was a long time in fading. \"Now they have,\" she snapped. \"And we're going to need more than just you if we're going to get past these things.\" Victor stepped close and peered past her. The faint smell of caramel about him taunted the poor girl. \"The Dead,\" he spoke matter-of-factly. \"I think we'll be a match. If you've learned anything from the woman we follow.\" Rose was ready to bark a sharp retort when Clovette butted in. \"Well:\" the woman remarked brightly, \"I suppose there's only one way to find out, isn't there?\"<br>Neither could take issue with the statement. So they found out.",
		"Victor and Rose waded into the throng of the Dead, bright knives flashing. Where Rose's weapon of choice was misshapen, ugly, brutal--Victor's was a multitude of slivers. He withdrew dozens of slender daggers from hidden places about his suit, and seemed not to mind losing them in one corpse or another. They slipped expertly into the thin places, the soft places, and dug deep. Clovette stepped in here and there, where her abilities allowed, but left it mostly up to her companions. Her laughter wound through the room as one by one, the scrabbling corpses went to pieces. It was neither of their best work, certainly not Rose's; after all, their eyes kept slipping to their sibling's strikes. He watched, impassive, as Rose stepped in with a hard thrust and followed it up with two more. She watched, thunderous, as Victor slipped past a pair of swiping hands and supplied their owner with a pair of needle-thin knives. Their distraction led to cuts here and there, inevitably. It was a messy affair. But after several moments, it was done. The corpses lay as if they had never held life, building blocks on the floor. They stepped over them. They continued. The worst was yet to come.",
		"If a true understanding of the place they had invaded had been hinted at so far, the final rooms made it impossible to ignore. Several laboratories whispered their secrets into Rose's ears: worms, burrowing parasites, animal hosts. Insects. Rodents. Cats.<br>And then, in the final room, the oppressive silence emanating from five yellowing plaster-cast forms. A bear, skin sunken, bones in clear relief. A dog, twisted unnaturally. Three humans. A man's shape, cowering like a Pompeiian ash figure in the final seconds of his terrified life. A woman, wood-plank rigid. A child--a child--perhaps five, four. The entry hole the worm had taken preserved under the eye, she could hear the child squalling as the thing bore its way in--",
		"Rose didn't feel well. She winced, her head aching, and stumbled. She had to grab a table for support. Dimly, she could see in the corners of her gaze that her companions were doing the same. Rose was reminded of the pain she'd felt the day her father had died: the anger, the despair. Later, the satisfaction. She swore she could hear creaking as an invisible ocean-weight force crushed her. The area of her vision grew smaller and smaller--the dark edges were eating it away at the edges. Eating <em>her.</em> She would surely perish--",
		"Clovette laughed. She had crumpled half over onto the table which held the recoiling man, and her posture had put her by his legs. She clapped a hand over her mouth but couldn't keep the mirth from escaping. \"Sorry, I know I shouldn't-- but--\" She pointed, finger shaking, at the plaster-cast. \"The hole,\" she managed, in between bouts of giggles, \"it's in the poor man's...\" the words dissolved into helpless laughter. She gestured at the man's buttocks. \"What a perfectly awful way to go!\" Victor smirked. He chuckled. Rose, disbelieving, felt her lips quirk before she could stop them. She laughed, almost, or would have. Clovette eventually did manage to get a grip on herself but they all found that, by the time she had, the feeling was gone. Or not quite gone--it felt like the boiling storm that had oppressed them was now drifting away, unwilling just yet to dispel completely. The horror of the research remained... but it was managable. One could stand it if one looked at it out of the corner of an eye.",
		"They found the treasures they were looking for in the man's stomach, or the cavern where it had been. Four books, each coded in a language more esoteric than the last. Languages were a study she had never taken to, not like her brother: though if he understood anything of what he read when he opened, and then closed one of the books, she couldn't say. Rose had something else on her mind.<br>An overdue confrontation with the woman she called her Mentor."

    "I used to think that saying was wrong, wretched--it seemed too much like a captor's remark. Now I don't think I'd care how many chains it would take to keep you here, just as long as you did stay... but I think if I managed to lock you away you'd just break free.",
    "That's sort of your calling, isn't it? To break away and go where you're most needed?",
    "How horrible that your most wonderful trait would be what keeps you from me.",
    "You cost me my friends. Did I ever tell you that? No, I can't imagine I ever did; it's not like me to voice my own pain much less use it against someone else. When you were left here in our forest my family didn't want any part of you. Only I, closest to the trees, listened to their whispers and took you in. Once they saw what a good child you were the other Kokiri took a liking to you, but they never forgot what was in their eyes a betrayal. We're taught to fear the outside world, did you know that? Otherwise we'd have Kokiri traveling the world--and none who do make that journey ever come back. I always kept those teachings from you because I had a feeling you'd one day walk Hylia's fields. And I was right, Link, I was right...",
    "I still remember rushing to meet you on that day you got a fairy all your own. I felt the death of the Deku Tree and I knew your departure wouldn't be far behind. I wish I'd had something to give you besides my old Ocarina, but believe me when I say it was my greatest treasure. Music brings these woods alive and I was always shy around you, Link. I could never bring myself to sing when I knew you'd hear. I always kept a happy tune in my head, even when you left; if nothing else would sustain me, then the music would.",
    "It was like having my heart torn out when you walked across that bridge. I never realized just how much you meant to me until that moment. The village only got worse, too: I saw the way the others just forgot about your presence and I couldn't speak to them for fear I'd say something vicious. Mido, always jealous, began to think of me as his own now that his chief rival was out of the picture. I thought his advances were unpleasant with you here, but soon I had to take to the woods just to escape from him. The forest is a home, Link. The forest is life, and small grasses waving, and strong trees that never ever bend... am I foolish for thinking, when you came back, you sought a life under these leaves? Like mine? I knew from the second I saw your smiling face the taste of adventure had you hooked, and even as I opened my mouth to sing my most precious song to you I knew it wouldn't be enough to hold you here. Would it have been sufficient a week, two weeks, a month earlier...? I try not to think about it.",
    "I knew I was just going to hurt myself by sharing that song with you. When you called to speak with me it was always for the benefit of the princess. I don't know what she did to capture your heart, but I can imagine. The allure of a strange girl of noble birth is strong, right? And I'm just plain Saria with no chest and a bad smile and a bunch of twigs for a roof. Honestly, I can't blame you for choosing her... but I can wish you chose differently. And I can dream it. Sometimes dreams are enough, even when the boy you love is talking with such excitement about the adventures he's going on far, far away from you. Would that I could chase after you, but I've always known I'd never leave the forest. I've known it as an undeniable truth, like the fact that the sun will rise every day and the fact that you will never be mine. So when you asked me about a quest for the princess, I could pretend it was enough just to hear your voice.",
    "But even that stopped. One day I couldn't feel you anymore and though I hoped for a hint, or a sign the next week and then the next... nothing ever came. It was like you disappeared off the face of Hyrule, and no matter how hard I tried to find you it was useless.",
    "The world got worse in those seven years you were missing, Link. The world got much worse. Even the forest I knew so well became frightening and dark. Shadows crept from the night to infest the brightest parts of my favorite clearings, driving me further and further back into the sacred Forest Temple. I found the deepest, smallest corner I could reach and I hid there in nameless fear of a man I did not know. I stayed there for longer than I could tell; we Kokiri cannot die of hunger or thirst--the forest provides--but if it was possible to die of loneliness I would have. It was an unspeakable joy to feel you again, see you again... but that brought a kind of pain with it as well.",
    "Perhaps I still held out a faint hope of capturing your heart, seven years later, because it still felt like my heart was breaking when I saw you were lost to me. When you played on an ocarina that wasn't mine--what did you do with my treasure, toss it away in favor of a shinier toy?--when you reached out for that gold-haired girl in disguise, when I saw you big and strapping and old... really, who could blame you for choosing the princess over me? I'm just plain, young Saria with no hips to speak of and a child's body and a bland personality. Who could blame you for choosing a woman over a girl? And I think I am a girl; I think I am a child and perhaps I always will be one. Because when I look at you I feel so small, so insignificant that I just want to curl up and cry... and when I can't help but imagine your arms encircling me, comforting me, it makes me feel a little bit better before it makes me feel a whole lot worse. The forest is a home, but it's not a lover and it's not a friend.",
    "And yet, even if I did somehow steal you away from princess Zelda I know you'd never really be mine. In your future I know there are faraway lands and strange people and monsters and things I've never heard of... and my world is just the sunlight shining through the leaves in woods that never change. Did you know that the Deku Tree sapling is the first green thing to really grow in this forest, Link? Sure, grass grows and bushes grow but everything is stunted. Everything stops at a certain height or length or width; that's why the Deku Tree is so special. I wish I was special like the sapling, Link... I wish I could grow like you and leave this forest and call you mine. But I can do none of those things and so once more I am simple, small Saria.",
    "Perhaps it's enough to support you from afar, Link. Perhaps it's enough to guide your way to the evil so you can fulfil your destiny to destroy it... but in some ways I wish you'd fail. I hear the rest of the world is as badly affected as the forest was before you freed it: perhaps you would come back here when Ganondorf bested you. Is it wrong to dream of comforting you in my own arms, soothing your wounds and nursing you back to health? Is it wrong to wish the whole of Hyrule burned around us so you'd never have reason to leave?",
    "And yet I know that would destroy the very nature of who you are. I know you're more than a hero; you're THE Hero, the one destined to save us or die trying. That's in your fate and the forest is in mine. Neither of us can be anything but what we are, and so I like to think it doesn't hurt as much as it would if we had a choice.",
    "I'll always be your friend and ally, Link, no matter whose ocarina you choose to play on. I'll always be waiting here, ready to listen to whatever you have to say.",
    "Remember that much when you defeat the evil plaguing this land. Come back to me, even if it's just for a day or an hour or a minute at a time. Just so I can see your face and imagine what it would be like to have those arms around my childish frame.",

		"Would you laugh if I said the most interesting thing to ever happen to me was you?",
    "I know, I know. A real farm girl, making trips to the castle every week, living in the midst of great times. What’s some lame fairy boy got to offer?",
    "See, that’s the same thing I asked myself when first we met. I couldn’t forget your face for no reason I can properly explain, though it probably doesn’t hurt that you’re kind of a bad boy. Climbing right past those guards, darting past them and into the castle… it’s enough to set a young maid’s heart a-flutter, let me tell you. More than capable, you were courageous. All that courage is like a drug to me, because I thrive off adventure. I was never really worried about that dumb old princess at first: princesses are supposed to be so staid and boring! How can you have fun inside an old drafty castle? I’ve never been in one personally but I can tell you a farm, with all its muck and hard work, will have infinitely more personality than a bunch of old stone.",
    "Maybe I shouldn’t have been so wrapped up in taking care of my deadbeat dad. Maybe then I would have had more time to catch your interest. I would always find myself thinking of you when my mind wandered, so imagine my surprise when I looked up from playing with the horses one day and saw your face! I felt so happy I just had to sing, and Epona is my best partner for that. She hated you when she first saw you–maybe she thought you’d steal me away, hm?–but with a little coaxing she just lit right up to you. For a fairy boy you were pretty good with that ocarina, though your sorry excuse for a getup could use some work. I had much more to share with you but I held off on it, figuring you’d come back to see me and Epona. There were games we could play, places we could go, adventures and all sorts of trouble we could get up to… but you never did come back. Not for seven years, anyway. And a lot changed in that time.",
    "The world got darker, Link. The first I knew of it a tall dark man was at our gates, some Gerudo leader. I don’t know what exactly he said to Ingo but he got puffed up in nothing flat. As soon as the man left Ingo kicked my dad right out and took over the farm! I would have followed my father but my hesitation cost me. I guess he saw me look towards the stables because it didn’t take him two seconds to threaten me through my precious friends. I know, I know. How lame is it for a girl to call animals her friends? But you never did come back. A girl has to take her friends where she can find them.",
    "And I did my best to care for them, though more often than not it meant taking blows meant for their hides. Most days it hurt to walk but I managed it without a grimace or a glare. I learned early on not to defy Ingo or catch his attention at all, although I never did get why he was so angry all the time. I don’t think me or dad treated him too poorly, but… well, it’s hard to say. And my dad’s off somewhere so I can’t ask him, though I doubt the answer would change much.",
    "The part that hurt the most was how he changed the horses. He bred and trained them only for racing and shows; he never cared when a horse cut its leg on the high jumps he constructed or when one of his fine racing stallions broke its leg. I saw him kill the poor thing and I couldn’t eat for a week. He beat me extra for that, said if I was going to die on him he’d make me suffer before I went. So I ate. What else was I gonna do?",
    "They call girls like me damaged goods, you know. That’s what they call girls who’ve been stepped on, beat and spat at, then worked to the bone… and I can’t find it in me to disagree. What’s so different between me and a slave? A courageous person like you would just throw off your shackles but I got snared instead. I think a bit of your courage rubbed off on Epona; she never bowed, not even for a second. Any rider who tried to mount her got pitched off fast. The last one who tried broke his arm in the fall and Epona nearly trampled him dead before Ingo could drag him away. He swore he’d kill my pony for that but I told him if he did I’d run and tell his master what had happened. He beat me extra but I didn’t die and neither did she. I think my nose got broken; it never set quite right and if you look close you can see it angles.",
    "Can I tell you a secret, Link? The first thing I thought of when he threatened Epona wasn’t that I’d be losing my closest friend… but the possibility you’d never come back if she died. Sometimes I had nightmares about you just leaving without even looking at me when you found out my pony was gone. There were other, nicer dreams too: a girl’s gotta have fantasies and when I needed a hero it was always your face that popped up. I won’t deny spending what time I did get alone thinking about you, and I won’t deny my hands wandering. You’d come sweeping in, depose Ingo and make my dad a good man again and… well, maybe I could teach you some other things this time.",
    "Maybe you think I’m a dirty girl for thinking like that, but I’ve been dirty all my life, whether from muck or dirt or bad thoughts. A growing girl’s got needs and I don’t doubt you could take care of me just how I want… if only you could see me as a woman. I imagined millions of ways I’d ensnare you when the time finally came, when you returned… but when you finally did I hardly recognized you. You looked like a man, nothing like the boy I remembered. When you made Ingo step down without raising a hand to him first I was so happy I thought I might die.",
    "Or at least, that was how I felt on the inside. I don’t grin that much anymore, though I think I put a pretty good fake smile on for you. When you talked to me all I could say was how glad I was of Ingo’s new change of heart and how I had absolutely no idea how it could have happened… but you never followed my unspoken question up. I was waiting for you to say “it was me,” and then I’d say “well, you can have anything you want as a reward,” and then… well, it didn’t happen like that. You never even took credit for what you’d done. You never touched me neither, and I guess I can’t blame you. I’m no high-born lady with class and pomp and a big castle, just a girl who was born and will die in the mud with livestock as friends. You left before I could work up the courage to say something, anything, and you never came back once. You took Epona too, so now I’m truly alone. All I have for company is the memory of your big hands and fiery eyes and broad chest… and all I have for the future are fantasies. I could tell you about them if you came and visited–maybe we could play some of them out–but I doubt you’d want that. I doubt you’d want someone like me, someone weak enough to be led around by dumb old Ingo. Some stupid farm girl who’s just damaged goods.",
    "But at least I’ve got fantasies. And at least I’ve got dreams, even though some of those dreams are nightmares that leave me crying… crying because you’re the most amazing thing to ever happen to me and I let you slip through my fingers."

Although, of course, I claimed you first. I doubt Princess Zelda said a single thing about marriage until you were big and strong and strapping, but I loved you when you weren’t. You should be grateful.",
    "I should be grateful. Did I ever really apologize for making you wade through that icky mess to save me from Lord Jabu-Jabu’s stomach? I probably didn’t thank you, either. I was a stuck-up little snot when I was young. Now I’m not so little anymore, but the rest? No promises.",

How could you? And you certainly can’t blame me for falling head over heels for the boy who came and rescued me. It’s hard not to get to like a boy who carries you around like a princess and saves you from evil monsters. You try it!",

I know you’ll always be there to help anyone, old or young, man or woman. It’s who you are. And it’s who I am to want more, always more. Do you hate selfish girls? It’s selfish of me, but I want to monopolize you–keep you all to myself. I want to spend all day in the shallows holding you, being held by you, and when someone says there’s trouble on the horizon we’ll say “go find someone else to help.”",
    "I know that could never happen. I knew it from the moment I saw you, seven years older, standing there looking like the man I knew you’d grow up to be. You took my breath away, Link. And I teased you, led you along through the temple, guided you once or twice but you didn’t need my help. Not really.",

Your eyes didn’t light up when you saw me, and they didn’t linger on my body, and they didn’t say “I love you” or “I missed you.” Or even “I remember our promise.” The only time you seemed really, truly alive was when you saw a new puzzle, a new enemy to beat. I could tell your thoughts were already preoccupied with the other princess courting your affections. I spent 7 years trying to learn how to lure you when you came back, ensnare you with my body–and it was hers you were imagining. Or maybe a Zora’s body just doesn’t interest you: I was stupid to hope otherwise.",
    "I was so stupid, not making you fall in love with me when I had a chance. Even if it couldn’t have ever been, at least I would have tried. At least I wouldn’t have lost you just because I was selfish, and prideful, and certain you’d never get a better offer.",

It’s fitting: I’m ugly and cold and my skin is slick just like one. But if you chose me I’d make you the happiest man in the world, I swear. I’d make you food every day and join you in bed every night, and everything a princess should say “no” to I’d say “please.”",
    "If you ever wanted anything my people would bring it to you. All I have to do is snap my fingers and they’ll give me whatever I ask. Of course, I’m selfish. I’m snotty and I’m ugly and I’m chained to the water like a dumb, flopping, choking fish. And I only ever wanted one thing.",

I was almost as much a mess then as when you pulled out your Ocarina—my Ocarina—and played along with me in the forest. It was so hard not to cry.",

I have nightmares where you lay me down in bed and look at me, and my clothes come off… and I have a man’s body underneath. I wake up reaching for you, calling out as you turn in disgust and you leave. You’re going to find out all the dirty parts of me and you’re going to come to hate me and you’re going to abandon me. I wouldn’t blame you: you’re the incarnation of hope and I’m just… Zelda. Not a very good princess. Not a very good girl. A really poor woman. I didn’t even make a good man.",

		"<em>You should have seen the last stand of the Dragon's Teeth.</em>",

		"I love playing Dungeons and Dragons, both as DM and as player. And as I play, I discover there are things I--or my players--would love to have to make their lives easier. So why not make them, and train my skills in the process?",
		"<img src='/images/articles/session0.png'>",
		"There are several tools bundled into this website, and likely more to come. Right now it's divided into three: first, a '<a href='https://critical-tools.netlify.app/session-zero/'>Session Zero</a>' form to be filled out on or before the first game you play. Do you want to play something stark, or something simple? Something safe, or something deadly? Making selections generates a code anyone can view, so you can just share the URL to discuss your preferences.",
		"<img src='/images/headers/critical.png'>",
		"Second is a selection of conditions which can be a real bear to distinguish--or to keep track of. Inspired by <a href='https://crobi.github.io/dnd5e-quickref/preview/quickref.html'>Crobi's 5e reference</a>, this summarizes the conditions and effects which might be on you, or on one of your enemies. Keep track of what's affecting you by clicking the requisite buttons by <a href='https://critical-tools.netlify.app/conditions/'>visiting the utility</a>.",
		"<img src='/images/articles/generator.png'>",
		"Finally, something a little simpler. I enjoy creating characters on the fly, but in order to make them fleshed out enough to feel like they're truly living and breathing, I've come up with a little generation method relying on the Tarot. The Major Arcana determines their Campbellian archetype, while a random card determines their personality and behavior. Using the same card flipping from this website, <a href='https://critical-tools.netlify.app/tarot-character/'>give it a try</a>!",
