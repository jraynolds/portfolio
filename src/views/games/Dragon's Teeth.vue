    <p><em>You should have seen them, standing there in the swamp like so many battlefield scarecrows. In their pitted lashed-together armor, holding their rusted weapons, tall and small, men and women of no common land or race or even age.
    <p>You should have seen them, standing against three battalions of the king's men. Outnumbered by a factor of ten. If each slew thirty men, it wouldn't have been enough.</p>
    <p>They stood there ankle-deep in the muck as if they could persuade the king by the force of their conviction alone, that the ones fleeing should be left alone. That they should be allowed to live their lives free.</p>
    <p>You should have seen them stand their ground when the finely-draped horses and the knights in golden armor began to move in. The king's men shone like a treasure hoard in the afternoon sun, all riding with the strength of their grandfathers behind them, their sterling pedigrees and their years of service.</p>
    <p>They stood no chance, these mercenaries in the mud. Not even a hundred. Standing on their own two feet.<br/>But when the knights fell upon them, they broke like water on a sharp stone. The golden armor was stained with red and their horses thrashed. The knights were dragged from their lofty perches and set upon as if by starving dogs. They screamed, in the mud and the muck, and they gurgled. They bled. They died.</p>
    <p>But the mercenaries were not invincible. If a sword met them it bit deep. If a blow found them it drew blood. They were not invincible.</p>
    <p>You should have seen them standing there, hands and feet and limbs missing, life draining. But while their hearts still beat, they fought. And they killed. Like madmen, they killed.</p>
    <p>You should have seen them fall, one by one, chopped to bits. Mangled. And finally they did not rise.</p>
    <p>You should have seen the king's finest generals gnash their teeth over their bitterly-won victory. How they clenched their fists! How they screamed and spat! They stood there in the muck and shook their swords at the setting sun.</p>
    <p>They stood there amongst eighty dead mercenaries and five hundred massacred knights, half a day lost. The rebels gone.</p>
    <p>You should have seen the last stand of the Dragon's Teeth.</p>
    <p>And you should have seen them start to stir underneath the muck, when all the knights had gone.</p></em>
