        <p><em>A lonely guy joins a group about reestablishing human connection in the mildly dystopic future--only to discover a deadly plot to uproot the nature of technology.</em></p>
        <p>Kickstarted with additional support from publisher <a href="https://sekaiproject.com/">Sekai Project</a>.</p>
        <p><img align="left" src="/assets/images/articles/Hitomi.png" style="height: 700px; width: auto; margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;"/>The Human Reignition Project is a Visual Novel coded in Ren'py, boasting 6 disparate storylines each with their own central character. My artistic direction can be most clearly seen in the character--and storyline--of Hitomi, a peppy girl who throws herself into her current passion with an intense and dangerous zeal.<br/><br/>
        Although I began work as a writer for the Hitomi route, my role in the development of the game has expanded over time. I'm now the principal coder as well as a one of the main storyline writers. However, I'm still 100% involved in the Hitomi storyline, so everything in her story is of my creation.<br/><br/>
        For more information on this ongoing project you can check the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sekaiproject/the-human-reignition-project-an-english-visual-nov/">Kickstarter page</a>, which is updated bi-monthly with progress reports and insight into the production of the game. We also have a <a href="https://discord.gg/PUA5t9s">Discord group</a>, available to those who aren't Kickstarter backers as well.<br/><br/>
        Estimated release of mid-2020.
