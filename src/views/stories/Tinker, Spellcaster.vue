            <p>He had been walking through the snow for eight hours, and had made several observations he could be sure of: after about an hour, one's legs began to burn. After four hours, all feeling went out of them. And after seven, one tended to lose track of time. The man in the cloak trudged on, carving dual trenches through the snow as soft flakes drifted down. Magic could solve all three of these problems, and he knew the spells: perhaps a strengthening enchantment for the legs, or a spell to quicken the blood. Perhaps a conjured hourglass to track the time. They were easily cast.</p>

            <p>The hours wore on. He'd observed something new by this time: after eleven (was it eleven?) hours, one's attention began to waver. Simple things like the snow-covered boughs of a faraway tree became impossible to look away from. A solitary snowflake would capture his attention as it fell through the air, slowly spiraling. More curiously, it would hold it even after the flake disappeared--instead of neatly shifting his focus to the next drifting object, the link would be broken. He would look at nothing at all. And after some time, he would stumble. He would fall in the snow, coating his cloak with dissolving white. He would grow colder still. He would come closer to death. Perhaps it wasn't too late: perhaps a large flame could dry him and chase the chill from his bones.<br>
            He trudged on.</p>

            <p>It was perhaps a long time before the man in the cloak realized something was different. He had fallen, like he had fallen many times before, but this time he had simply failed to get up. He was sinking into a snowdrift and had the distinct sensation of falling. He had the feeling that every moment brought him an inch deeper into the snow, and brought another inch of snow falling down on top of him. It was possible, he imagined, to pick himself up out of the snow, but every part of his body disagreed. It was all he could do to turn his head towards the sky, to peer at the indistinct shapes above him. To try and listen to the vague noises amidst the snow. Curious, he thought. That on death's doorstep, he would begin to hallucinate.<br>
            Black began to eat away at the edges of his vision. He could be saved yet, if he only brought himself somewhere safe. It was a difficult spell, to travel instantaneously. Only the most skilled magicians could do it, and only then with preparation. There were dangers, to be sure, but all of them paled before the specter of death around him. Could his frost-covered fingers make the motions? Could his chattering mouth form the words?<br>
            He would never know. He closed his eyes and the blackness overtook him. He was floating, perhaps for a very long time.</p>

            <p>It wasn't the sort of blackness that one expected to wake up from, but wake up he did. Slowly, and in fits, but eventually he did come to wakefulness. The man in the bed opened his eyes to see a roughly-worked wooden roof above his head, a warm fire crackling in the hearth. He drew air into his lungs and coughed, hacked, spasmed in the scratchy sheets. When he recovered he noticed the young boy sitting on the table watching him, head cocked. Blond hair a complete mess. "You're new," he said, and the invalid nodded.<br>
            "I just rolled in," he said, or tried to--there was a great deal of coughing. But once he understood, the boy shook his head.<br>
            "Now you're new," the boy clarified. "You need a new name."<br>
            "Ah." There was a moment of contemplation before he waved one bandaged arm and said the first name that had popped into his head: "Tom, I suppose."<br>
            "Tom." The boy nodded. "I'm Alec. You're a carpenter."<br>
            "I am?"<br>
            "Well. You are now. We need one."
            "We?"<br>
            "Our village. You ask a lot of questions."<br>
            The man in the bed--Tom--nodded. <br>
            "It's annoying," the boy complained, and hopped off the table. He walked straight for the door and was out it before Tom could ask anything more. The invalid was left to contemplate his new name and the new life that came with it. A carpenter? He'd never so much as hammered a nail. He knew a spell that could do the trick, as sure as he knew one that could drop this strange house around him. One that could set the wood around him on fire. A simple one that could twist his neck so far and so quick he'd never feel a thing. <br>
            "Tom," he said out loud, like he was experimenting fitting his lips around it. "Tom."<br>
            Perhaps even a monster like him could start over.</p>
