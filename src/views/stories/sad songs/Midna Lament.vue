        <p>I liked you better as a stupid dog.</p>

        <p>You were cute in a wolf way when I found you, you know--all agitated and barky trying to get used to having four paws instead of two. Without me, you'd probably still be stuck in that crummy jail cell, chained up and rotting away! I guess if you put it like that, I'm the real hero of Hyrule. I found the Hero of Time and made sure he wouldn't just waste away as a little wolfy! Out of the goodness of my own heart, of course.</p>

        <p>You were the first person to ever help me, you know that? I know it's kind of a non sequitor, and I don't even know why I'm saying it really, except it just sort of felt like I should. When Zant took the shadow pieces we'd collected and hurt me like I did, when I was almost about to die... I kind of expected that to be it. You know? Like go to sleep and never wake up. And I was really mad at Zant of course but I was also... really scared. I mean, not that I ever get scared. But I got close. And then it was like a fever dream, riding on your back as you carried me all the way to Hyrule Castle. I think if it was anyone else I might not be alive still. I don't remember much beside just fading in and out but I remember how fast you ran. Like the wind. I guess all that time on your back spurring you along paid off, huh?</p>

        <p>Um...<br>
        I'm not good at any of this. Thank you, is what I'm trying to say. I know how hard you worked to keep me from fading, even after how I treated you that whole time. Little wolfy carried me all the way to... Zelda.</p>

        <p>Don't get me wrong, Zelda's a good person. I can see why you like her. I like her, and I don't like anyone! Hard not to appreciate a classically beautiful blonde with a bright little kingdom and cheery people and a heart so big she'd toss her life away for a Twili. I get it. I mean, for pretty much all of my time with you I was short and squat and ugly, and even though my true form is drop-dead gorgeous in the realm of the Twili, I only ever got to show it to you for a second. You're just a dumb dog, so I bet you didn't think twice when I said after I passed through the portal I'd never see you again. When I walked so slow. When I turned back to look at you. </p>

        <p>What's there to say? You didn't follow me. You stayed there with Zelda. I get it, wolfy. You don't have to spell it out for me. You'll run off with her or maybe do your hero thing forever, and I'll probably marry some Twili prince or something. Find a handsome fellow. And dream of being once more able to visit your world. It's not so bad at night.</p>

        <p>And when I remember being in your world I'll remember those early days running around fighting Zant's beasts, riding on my wolfy's back. Running my hands through your fur and teasing you. Feeling the wind on my skin.<br>
        Maybe if I'd snared you then you'd still be mine, and this world of twilight would be a little less dark. </p>
