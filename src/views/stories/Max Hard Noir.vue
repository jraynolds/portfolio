            <p>Elijah Wesson stood stiffly in the Police Chief's office, looking every bit the new recruit he was. Chief Lester, first and last name offered on the plaque on his desk, muttered into his rotary phone and took sips from his rapidly-cooling coffee. Elijah ignored the repeated flicks of the Chief's eyes: "sit down", he mouthed, but gave up when the recruit just shook his head. At last the phone call finished. He set down the receiver and shuffled papers around on his desk. "Elijah. Mind if I call you Eli?"</p>

            <p>"Prefer not, sir," the recruit replied. "Elijah is the name my father gave me and if it's all the same, I'll keep it."</p>

            <p>"Best if you learn to relax," the chief remarked mildly, but just shrugged when Elijah lapsed back into silence. "Well, suit yourself. A little prim-and-proper might do your partner some good. He's--"</p>

            <p>And then the door to the police office swung open and Max Hardgrove walked in.<br>
            Heads turned. Eyes widened. The handsome dame at the third desk blushed and bit her lip. Max Hardgrove, six feet tall minus his half-cocked trilby, had that effect. He ignored it as he swept into the Chief's office. A cigarette glowed between his fingers and he tapped the ash onto the carpeted floor, earning him a disgusted glare from Elijah. He scratched at the 5-o'clock shadow on his chin and growled out the following: "Max Hard, at your service. Now make it quick."</p>

            <p>Elijah's eyes flashed. He opened his mouth to chastise the detective--no matter who he thought he was--but was cut off and startled by the Chief suddenly slamming a fist down on his desk. "Dammit Max," he roared, "you're lucky I'm letting you keep your badge after what you pulled last week!"</p>

            <p>The detective took a long drag from his cigarette and blew the smoke towards the ceiling. "Tell me, Chief, are the robbers gone or not?"</p>

            <p>"That's not--" the Chief began, his face turning red, but Max just interrupted him before he could get going. "Cut to the chase, Chief. You called me away from the big case. What's so important, another triple homicide? They shut down the banks?"</p>

            <p>"You're getting a partner, Max," the Chief slammed his desk again, "and that's final!" Someone needs to keep an eye on your loose cannon ways. This is Elijah, and he's a rising star. Follows the rules, a legal eagle! You could stand to learn a thing or two from him."</p>

            <p>For a long moment no one spoke. Elijah had almost recovered from the abrupt shift in tone when Max flicked his cigarette to the floor and ground it out with his heel. "Fine", he growled out. "I quit." The detective pulled out his badge and unholstered his six-shooter, then slammed them down on the Chief's desk. The impact rattled his coffee cup and jangled his rotary phone, as well as sent the plaque bearing simply "The Chief" falling face-down.</p>

            <p>Max turned, his trenchcoat whipping in a wind Elijah hadn't noticed, and strode to the door. Good riddance, the greenhorn thought, frankly infuriated by everything about this detective. But to his surprise, Max never made it out. "Hold it," the Chief shouted, his knuckles white as he gripped his desk. "Max, Goddammit but you're the best we've got. No partner, you just keep on fighting the good fight. Now get over here and grab your damn badge."</p>

            <p>Elijah watched incredulously as Max, expression unflinchingly grim, strode back to scoop up his possessions. He didn't seem surprised by the outcome; far from it, he acted like he'd known this would happen all along. It heated Elijah's blood and he opened his mouth to say something--anything--but couldn't push the words out. It was like trying to speak through cement. But finally he managed one word: "No."</p>

            <p>Both the Chief and the detective turned to face him, and he wasn't sure who looked more surprised. Elijah's face flushed but he pushed on: luckily, the words came easier after the first. "You heard the Chief. I'm your partner from now on. Those are the rules. And besides, detectives have to work in pairs. Policy." </p>

            <p>The Chief spluttered, finally stammering out "Now kid, I know you don't know who this is, but..." his words trailed off as Max held up a hand. Elijah had been watching his expression: until he recovered, the detective had looked absolutely, positively shocked. Far more than the circumstances should afford. But he regained his composure and a wind blew through again from somewhere, stirring his coat. He'd plucked out another lit cigarette at some point. Elijah wasn't sure how he'd missed it happen.</p>

            <p>"What's your name, kid?" Max asked, and got a frown in return. The Chief had introduced him already, hadn't he? "Elijah Wesson," he answered. "Eli Watson," Max repeated, and nodded to himself. "A good pair of names. Alright, I'll make an exception just this once. Come with me and I'll explain our case on the way." And without further fanfare he swept out of the room. Eli looked back at the Chief and then went hurrying after.</p>

            <p>"My name," Eli began as he caught up to the detective, "my name..." but he couldn't quite remember what he'd been trying to say. Something about his father. Something important. He shook his head and abandoned the topic, looking back instead at the office: "The Chief went crazy when you walked in. I guess he awas giving me the good cop treatment." He noticed the Chief setting his desk back up, cup and phone and plaque, which read "David Lester"--just like it always had. Hadn't it?</p>

            <p>Something felt wrong to Elijah--Eli. To Eli Watson. Something felt very wrong, but he just couldn't figure out what.</p>
